# 3 Organizing and Delivering Information

>When we begin to write, we may anticipate the result, but writing has a way of taking on its own life.

Once you’ve identified to whom you are writing and assured yourself that your data are acceptable, consider how to put ideas and information together. This is often the most difficult part of the writing process. You may know what you need to say but may be stymied as to how to get it down on paper. This is normal; most people simply don’t like to write. There are, however, some techniques for organizing information that can help you control your ideas as you commit them to paper. Don’t be surprised, either, if you violate your initial concept of how you are going to deliver your information. The act of writing itself triggers new ideas, and this is to the good. 

Any time you create a document, look at it from two angles: logic and development of ideas. The distinctions aren’t always as neat and clear-cut as they are for the purposes of this book, however, and you may find many different ways of presenting information that work well. These guidelines are merely that: guidelines. They’ll help you control your information when you’re not sure how to present it. 

You will frequently encounter problems in organization—situations where the ideas themselves are good, but not presented in a way that makes their meaning obvious or their purpose clear. In short, how can you best organize your information so that your messages work the way they should? 

## Categorize Your Information

To effectively organize information, it helps to categorize what you are conveying— is it good? routine? negative? persuasive? If you anticipate the reader’s reaction to different categories of information, you’ll know better how to present it. Surely you wouldn’t respond to a request for an internal job transfer by saying, right off the bat, “You can’t have the job because you lack the necessary skills.” Yet, you might begin a note of recognition like this: “Congratulations, Joe. You certainly deserve this promotion.” In the first instance, the reaction would surely be more negative than you desire. In the second, the reaction will likely be as positive as you hope. You gain nothing by irritating the recipient—nor do you benefit by working up to a message of goodwill. More important, withholding information or obscuring it can have deleterious effects on the day-to-day activities that make a business run. 

>Writing is easy. All you do is sit staring at a blank sheet of paper until drops of blood form on your forehead.
>——Gene Fowler, Author

The majority of the writing you will do in the pharmaceutical industry will fall into the category of delivering routine information. For the most part, you are not eliciting an emotional response; you are presenting information your readers need to have. Use these guidelines for logical presentation. But remember: They are not cast in stone. 

Finally, writing isn’t easy. Nothing says you have to “begin at the beginning and go to the end.” You may be best off getting the details down and then rearranging them for readability and comprehension.
