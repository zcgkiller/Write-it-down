# 3 Organizing and Delivering Information

>When we begin to write, we may anticipate the result, but writing has a way of taking on its own life.
>——Alexander Butrym,
>Ph.D., Professor of English

Once you’ve identified to whom you are writing and assured yourself that your data are acceptable, consider how to put ideas and information together. This is often the most difficult part of the writing process. You may know what you need to say but may be stymied as to how to get it down on paper. This is normal; most people simply don’t like to write. There are, however, some techniques for organizing information that can help you control your ideas as you commit them to paper. Don’t be surprised, either, if you violate your initial concept of how you are going to deliver your information. The act of writing itself triggers new ideas, and this is to the good. 

Any time you create a document, look at it from two angles: logic and development of ideas. The distinctions aren’t always as neat and clear-cut as they are for the purposes of this book, however, and you may find many different ways of presenting information that work well. These guidelines are merely that: guidelines. They’ll help you control your information when you’re not sure how to present it. 

You will frequently encounter problems in organization—situations where the ideas themselves are good, but not presented in a way that makes their meaning obvious or their purpose clear. In short, how can you best organize your information so that your messages work the way they should? 

## Categorize Your Information

To effectively organize information, it helps to categorize what you are conveying— is it good? routine? negative? persuasive? If you anticipate the reader’s reaction to different categories of information, you’ll know better how to present it. Surely you wouldn’t respond to a request for an internal job transfer by saying, right off the bat, “You can’t have the job because you lack the necessary skills.” Yet, you might begin a note of recognition like this: “Congratulations, Joe. You certainly deserve this promotion.” In the first instance, the reaction would surely be more negative than you desire. In the second, the reaction will likely be as positive as you hope. You gain nothing by irritating the recipient—nor do you benefit by working up to a message of goodwill. More important, withholding information or obscuring it can have deleterious effects on the day-to-day activities that make a business run. 

>Writing is easy. All you do is sit staring at a blank sheet of paper until drops of blood form on your forehead.
>——Gene Fowler, Author

The majority of the writing you will do in the pharmaceutical industry will fall into the category of delivering routine information. For the most part, you are not eliciting an emotional response; you are presenting information your readers need to have. Use these guidelines for logical presentation. But remember: They are not cast in stone. 

Finally, writing isn’t easy. Nothing says you have to “begin at the beginning and go to the end.” You may be best off getting the details down and then rearranging them for readability and comprehension. 

### The Direct Approach

>I hate to write, but I love having written.
>——Dorothy Parker, Author

Use this pattern for presenting most of the information you relay in writing. The direct approach is effective for routine information— the work-specific writing you do. When you are writing a short memo or technical note, for instance, let this pattern govern your total delivery of information. When you are writing a document of length, break it into segments, and use this pattern to help you control your overall delivery as well as your delivery in each part.

The direct approach calls for making the key point first. This way, your reader will immediately know what a document, or portion of a document, is about. Your point logically leads to information that supports it. Unfortunately, when most people write about what they’ve done or what they’re going to do, they tend to approach documenting the past or projecting future activity sequentially, the way they have addressed or will address completion of the task itself. Writing sequentially seems logical, and indeed, it reflects inductive reasoning: A series of facts leads to a conclusion. However, the reader is best served by understanding the point first—whether it is a summary of findings, a strategic decision, or the results of an investigation. 

Usually, delaying the point doesn’t make a document any more effective. Your reader does not know the purpose of a document the way you did before you even began to write it. Thus, inductive presentation is not the best way for most readers to receive information. With inductive presentation the reader doesn’t get the point until he reaches at the end of a document or passage in a document. Readers understand messages best when a point is followed by a series of facts that support the point. 

For instance, by the time an engineer prepares a summary of an installation/ operation qualification (IQ/OQ), she has been working on the project for a long time. She has already written a protocol of what she planned to do and has secured the necessary approval. Then she’s gone through the testing process. Chances are, she may have had some nonconformances along the way. Once she’s assured herself the equipment installation and operation meet qualification criteria for the company’s needs-specific purposes, she has gone through a step-by-step process. 

Yet there’s no benefit in preparing a report for approval of the qualification by saying, “In July it was time to requalify the 200-gallon batching kettle with double motion counterrotating agitator” and then detailing events chronologically. What the readers need here is an immediate statement that asserts that the equipment is qualified, partially qualified, or not qualified as a result of the testing according to the protocol. An IQ/OQ summary report is easy to understand when it begins straightforwardly like this: 

The Lee Industries 200-gallon batching kettle with double motion counterrotating agitator meets all the installation/operation qualification requirements. All test functions established in Protocol Q023 are complete and reconciled. In carrying out the testing, we addressed three nonconformances. All test results are attached. 

>If you have an important point to make, don’t try to be subtle or clever. Use a pile driver. Hit the point once. Then come back and hit it again. Then hit it a third time—a tremendous whack.
>——Winston Churchill

The summary report then can go on to explain nonconformances and their impacts and state requirements for scheduled requalification and so forth. This way, the readers know immediately the results of the qualification testing and are ready for what the report contains. Here’s a basic pattern for presenting information: 

The beginning:								State your purpose. What point do you want your reader to know?
										 				 What, if anything, do you want your reader to do?

The supporting information:	   Offer details to substantiate your purpose.

The close:										Tell your reader what he or she needs to know to be convinced.
														  Restate the point or call for action.

#### Packaging Specification Change

The information in this short memo isn’t as effective as it could be because it doesn’t make its point up front. The reader is subject to explanatory details before learning the purpose of the communication.

    <p>
        We decided to make Quinine Sulfate 200 mg capsules dose proportional to the 325 mg strength. For the Quinine Sulfate 200 mg capsules we had been using number 2 size capsules and 100 cc capacity bottles. 
    </p>
    <p>
        However, the number 2 size capsules are inadequate for the 325 mg dose. Therefore we decided to use the number 1 size capsules. Then we determined it to be too difficult to accommodate one hundred number1 size capsules in the 100 cc bottle along with the insert. We also realized that 100 number 1 size capsules and the insert would be difficult to fit into the 100 cc bottle. To accommodate the new capsules, we changed the bottle size from 100 cc to 150 cc and added rayon to fill the empty space on top of the capsules. This solution is satisfactory, and we have changed our packaging specifications accordingly. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Even though this memo is short, it’s easier to understand when the key idea comes first. The point is not to explain the decision to make the capsules dose proportional to 325 mg, but to detail the consequences and subsequent decisions about packaging. In the following version, the reader reasonably looks to the information after the first statement to back up that statement, and it does.

#### Drug Recall Letter

The Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) defines the content of recall letters; it calls for a clear presentation of the point up front. This letter does that effectively and is a solid example of the direct approach for organizing information. The purpose is stated immediately in bold letters, before the salutation, as well as in the second sentence. The reader knows at a glance what’s afoot.

        Dear Wholesaler/Retailer:
    </p>
    <p>
        Recent tests indicate that some outstanding lots of 50 mg suppositories do not meet minimum assay requirements through their expiration dates. Because we are uncertain that all lots will meet assay requirements throughout their shelf life, we are recalling all unexpired lots of this product. These lots have potency assays ranging from 59% to 100%. In addition, we have been unable to identify a degradation product; the concentration levels are unknown. This represents a potential health hazard, but we believe that the probability of serious adverse health consequences is remote. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Please determine if you have any lots on hand. If you do, discontinue distribution of these lots and return the merchandise to our facility promptly, to my attention. Please complete and return the enclosed response form as well. If you have any questions call 306-123-4567, extension 525. 
    </p>
    <p>
        If you have distributed any of these lots, please contact your accounts immediately; advise them of the recall; and have them return their outstanding recalled stocks to you. We are conducting this recall to the retail/dispensing level. Return these stocks as indicated above. We will reimburse you by credit memo for the returned goods and postage. 
    </p>
    <p>
        We have informed FDA of this recall. We appreciate your assistance in this matter.

### The Direct Approach in Report Sections

You can apply the same principles of delivery in segments of reports. Even if a report has a clean, comprehensive summary at the beginning, the information within each component of the document is easier to comprehend when it makes a point and logically supports it. 

The following is a portion of a product development report. The point is to identify which batch the company will use as the standard to manufacture a product. Notice that the writer has delivered the information in the sequence in which it occurred. Where does the information the reader wants to know lie? 

> Ronway Laboratories initiated the formulation development for sodium capsules in January, 2005. Our strategy has been to employ exponents similar to those used in brand formulation combined by a dry mixing method. Folles SA manufactured the available active entity. 
>
> The goal was to develop 50 mg strength first and then follow up with 100 mg strengths. Appendix A includes the formulation experiments conducted during formulation development. 
>
> The formulation lot numbers are five digits. The prefix 123 refers to the laboratory notebook housing the records of the development of this product, and the subsequent numbers refer to the batch.
>
> Lots 123-01 to 123-14 incorporated Lactose Anhydrous DT, and Lactose Hydrous SD Starch P21 in different ratios and combinations with Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, Magnesium Stearate, and, in the case of lot 123-11, Aerosil 200, to achieve good encapsulation properties of the blend and to match the dissolution profile of the brand capsules. 
>
> We accomplished this effort with lot 123-14, and manufactured pilot batch PB987 accordingly. However, this batch developed stability problems under accelerated conditions. 
>
> Lots 123-15 to 123-28 reflect the attempts to develop a second formulation employing Magnesium Stearate and Aerosil 200 in combination with Starch P21. Lot 123-28 exhibited good encapsulation properties and similar dissolution patterns to the brand product. However, concurrent to development of this batch, material became unavailable for further development. 
>
> We then made and tested Lot 123-29, similar in formulation to lot 123- 28, but employing Magnesium Stearate manufactured by Nogodawa Pharmaceuticals. Results indicate that this lot is comparable to brand in dissolution behavior and is stable under accelerated conditions. Thus, Lot 123-29 is the base for pilot batch PI988. 

The very last sentence is what the readers want to know. All the information is here—but a simple revision, almost a cut and paste, makes this information easier to digest. Since the key information rests in the last paragraph, moving that information to the beginning both clarifies and allows for logical explanation of what follows. A simple edit to paragraph two and a brief statement of closure completes this section of the development report. 

> Ronway Laboratories will use Lot 123-29 as the base for pilot batch PI988. Results indicate that this lot is comparable to brand in dissolution behavior and is stable under accelerated conditions. 
>
> We initiated the formulation development for XYZ capsules in March, 2005. Our strategy has been to employ exponents similar to those used in brand formulation combined by a dry mixing method. Folles SA manufactured the available active entity. 
>
> The goal was to develop 50 mg strength first and then follow up with 100 mg strengths. Appendix A includes the formulation experiments conducted during formulation development. 
>
> The formulation lot numbers are five digits. The prefix 123 refers to the laboratory notebook housing the records of the development of this product, and the subsequent numbers refer to the batch. 
>
> Lots 123-01 to 123-14 incorporated Lactose Anhydrous DT, and Lactose Hydrous SD Starch P21 in different ratios and combinations with Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, Magnesium Stearate, and, in the case of lot 123-11, Aerosil 200, to achieve good encapsulation properties of the blend and to match the dissolution profile of the brand capsules. 
>
> We accomplished this effort with lot 123-14, and manufactured pilot batch PB987 accordingly. However, this batch developed stability problems under accelerated conditions.

However, concurrent to development of this batch, material became unavailable for further development.

### Good News

>Reading makes a full man, conference a ready man, and writing an exact man.
>——Francis Bacon

For most documentation purposes, you will deliver information most effectively using the direct approach. Sometimes, however, you may need to deliver information that is not directly linked to documentation, but serves to drive everyday activities. You will find that the direct approach works well for good news, too. People, of course, like to receive good news, and when you make your point up front, your readers are much more likely to absorb the details that reinforce the positive point. The following memorandum from a company president announces the appointment of three people to company positions. It follows this pattern: 

Paragraph one: States the good news
Paragraph two: Gives details about Gary Williams
Paragraph three: Gives details about Christian Matthews
Paragraph four: Gives details about Stan Syvertsen
Paragraph five: Closes on a friendly note

### Indirect Approach

While this book advocates the direct approach as the primary pattern for delivery of information for documentation, sometimes you may find the indirect approach more appropriate. The indirect approach calls for presenting information that leads to a point. 

This pattern is useful for certain information. Reports like investigations typically deliver a sequence of events, an assessment, and a plan for action. And less-than-positive information works best when the negative news is delayed a bit. 

### Negative News

If you are in a position to determine the suitability of contract manufacturers or suppliers, for instance, you may on occasion have to deliver negative news. Suppose you determine an outside laboratory’s testing standards have deteriorated and you wish to stop employing the services, at least temporarily, until the laboratory can improve its standards. In such a case, the indirect approach may work well. You can reasonably explain your position before you state it. This provides a better opportunity for retaining goodwill should circumstances change in the future and you wish to reestablish business relations. 

Delivering negative news is never easy. People naturally hesitate to come right out and state the message they know will be ill-received, particularly if they wish to retain goodwill. But at times, people do have to bear bad news. This letter to a production team provides a paradigm for delivering bad news: 

Paragraph one: Presents mutually agreeable information 

Paragraph two: Offers explanatory details that lead to the main point, states the point, and offers more information 

Paragraph three: Offers further explanation, as appropriate 

Paragraph four: Closes on a positive note

    <b>TO:</b> All Employees
    <b>DATE:</b> March 21, 2005
    <b>FROM:</b> Ingvald Landrud
    <b>RE:</b> Third Shift Notice
    <p>
        We appreciate the dedicated efforts of all of you on the third shift. You have been a vital part of our production activities and an integral part of Lyngdal Laboratories.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, we have lost two significant accounts to competitors who can offer more rapid production because of a significantly smaller product line overall, and newer facilities. That’s why we must temporarily suspend our third shift activities while we modernize our packaging equipment to be competitive. You will, of course, receive unemployment compensation and other benefits to which you are entitled. Your supervisors will further explain the impact of our temporary suspension of the third shift and direct you to any additional assistance you may need during this period. 
    </p>
    <p>
        We hope to resume production as quickly as possible; we do not anticipate a prolonged work cessation. We will notify you of shift resumption at the earliest practical time.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the meantime, please be reassured. This work suspension in no way reflects negatively on the performance of the third shift. We will make every effort to resume production as quickly as possible, and we hope to have you there on the team when it does.
    </p>
</div>

### Persuasion

>Whatever we well understand, we express clearly, and words flow with ease.
>——Nicholas Boileau

On the occasion when you need to ask a favor of someone but anticipate a negative response, use an indirect pattern. Bear in mind that most requests are routine and the direct approach will suffice. A contractor or vendor, for instance, is generally happy to supply a response to a request. Using the indirect approach, however, will help you when you need to convince someone to take action, to respond to a request when you anticipate the initial reaction may be negative. It’s human nature to be happy to be asked but reluctant to comply. Consider asking someone to speak at a professional meeting, for example. Most people hate, more than anything, to speak in front of a group. So, in this case, the reader might be flattered but reply negatively, which is not what you want.

The following letter can use revision.

What’s likely to happen here is this: The recipient will read as far as the second sentence, and his mind will say “no way.” Even though the second paragraph recognizes the reader’s expertise, he has already mentally responded to the request made in the first—very likely negatively. Reworking the request so that interest develops first makes this letter much more effective.

#### rewrite

This revised version builds to the request. And by the time the request is made, the reader knows that he has something to offer that no one else has. It’s hard to say “no” to that. This letter follows this pattern:
Paragraph one: Gain your reader’s interest.
Paragraph two: Offer details and build to your request.
Paragraph three: Close and call for action.

### Uniting the Direct and Indirect Approaches

Many documents, especially reports of length, combine the direct and indirect approaches for delivering information effectively. For instance, a technical report may begin with a summary that states the main idea in the first sentence and cites key points to follow. Individual sections then present information that supports those points. Some sections in the report may provide information sequentially, particularly if they discuss procedures or events leading up to a current position.

A Standard Operating Procedure (SOP), for example, uses a mixed pattern of delivery. A purpose or objective statement tells at a glance what the document is about—and the reader is prepared for the sequential steps that will lead to completion of the task.

## Using an Outline

Many writers wouldn’t venture into the murky waters of writing without an outline, yet outlines aren’t for everybody. An outline may indeed help chart your course and serve as your guide as you develop your document, particularly if it is lengthy. But there are some cautionary notes here. While outlines can help, they can also defeat if they prevent you from exploring an innovative idea triggered by the writing process. If you prefer to use an outline, use it as a guide, not a mandate. Some writers work best with no outlines; they impose structure as the document progresses. Still others prefer a rigid outline, which will work for those who do a great deal of mental mulling before they write. Still others work best with a loosely defined outline that expands and contracts as the document takes form. Which method you adopt depends on you as a writer. There’s no “must do” here—it’s a matter of discovering what works best for you. 

## Developing Paragraphs

Think of each paragraph you write as a mini-piece of documentation. Generally, give each idea its own paragraph and provide enough information to convince. You can use the direct or indirect approach for your paragraphs as well, depending on the message you want to deliver. In most instances, each paragraph should have one sentence that states the controlling idea. The other sentences should provide proof to support that idea.

### Starting with the Controlling Idea

You can present information clearly using the direct approach in individual paragraphs. When you give your readers the controlling idea first, they will be receptive to receiving what is next. The following paragraph discusses a two-tier team effort, and the first sentence sets the stage. 

> Instituting a program of production equipment maintenance at Ronway Laboratories requires a two-tier team effort. A core team of Maintenance and Engineering employees trained in the aspects of TQM should form the first-tier team, with one employee serving as group leader. Each member of the core team, in turn, will assume responsibility for directing a team in developing the maintenance program for a specific piece of equipment or group of equipment. The intent is to impart “ownership” of the equipment maintenance to designated teams. 

Sometimes one controlling sentence can carry more than one paragraph of explanatory information. This is a call you must make. The following paragraph is from an information report generated when a company decided to purchase a new mixer for making a topical product. While it does the job, it is lengthy, with several ideas that support the first sentence, and offers the reader no chance to pause while absorbing the information. 

> The mixer we purchase must be suitable for our needs. The shape of the mixer and the rigidity of the blades, as well as the effectiveness of scrapers, are primary concerns. Since thorough and consistent scraping of the mixer walls is vital to blend uniformity, internal surfaces must be accessible to receive adequate scraping so that residual material does not become part of the batch and result in nonuniformity. The scraper blades must be rigid enough to effectively scrape the walls, but not so much so as to damage the walls. Another concern is mixing capability; inadequate mixing that permits portions of the batch to remain stationary can result in “dead spots.” Overly rigid mixer blades may provide good mixing, but impede scraping. Blades with too much flexibility, on the other hand, may not effectively mix a formula with the viscosity of ours. Blades should therefore be of a firm plastic that will provide adequate mixing and permit scraping of mixer walls during processing without damaging the interior surface. 

Readability improves dramatically when this lengthy passage is broken into two paragraphs, both controlled by the first sentence in the first paragraph. 

> The mixer we purchase must be suitable for our needs. The shape of the mixer and the rigidity of the blades, as well as the effectiveness of scrapers, are primary concerns. Since thorough and consistent scraping of the mixer walls is vital to blend uniformity, internal surfaces must be accessible to receive adequate scraping so that residual material does not become part of the batch and result in nonuniformity. The scraper blades must be rigid enough to effectively scrape the walls, but not so much so as to damage the walls.

Blades should therefore be of a firm plastic that will provide adequate mixing and permit scraping of mixer walls during processing without damaging the interior surface. 

### Leading to a Conclusion

Often a paragraph, such as the following one, offers a series of details that lead to a conclusion. This paragraph, from an out-of-specification (OOS) report, details a series of events; it is a causal presentation of information. The result of an OOS investigation is the main point of the paragraph, and it comes last. 

> As soon as the microbiologicial out-of-specification result occurred, the analyst notified the supervisor. The supervisor then authorized a second analyst to retest the original laboratory sample using a sample triple the size of the original. While the analyst retested the sample, the supervisor reviewed all documentation relative to the OOS. The retest failed to isolate the aberrant data and verified the original result. Analyst error, technical malfunction, and media contamination were ruled out, and an assignable cause proved to be inconclusive. The supervisor notified QA, and QA subsequently rejected the batch. 

The following paragraph effectively cites a condition first, with an explanation of subsequent action. 

> QC discovered that the in-house HPLC/2323/ASI Revision 3 analyses of the related compounds tests were flawed, and the results are invalid. The lot involved was L211; the test stations were one-month accelerated and three-month accelerated. QC corrected the problem at the nine month test station. As a result, the 12-month test station results are valid, and the 12-month results show that all the room temperature samples are within specification. 

### Giving Adequate Information

Even if you organize your information appropriately, your paragraphs may somehow lack the essential ingredients for convincing your reader. This problem is often one of idea development. Ideas need to be spelled out, or enhanced in such a way that they elicit the right response from the reader. 

The following paragraph from a chemical hygiene plan would benefit from more detail.

> Hot glassware can be dangerous. Be careful when handling it.

Why is hot glassware dangerous? What can laboratory personnel do to minimize the danger? What do they need to do? A good directive includes the answers to questions such as these. Consider this rewrite:

> Take care when removing glassware from heat since hot glassware can cause severe burns. Never attempt to hold hot glassware without adequate protection, because the item can fall and break, causing hot liquids to splatter. Use asbestos gloves or appropriate tongs. Use utility tongs to handle small apparatus and crucibles, and beaker tongs to hold and carry small beakers. 

This rewrite has the strength of focusing on concrete specifics in an orderly way, and it provides thorough coverage of a procedure. Remember when English teachers told you that paragraphs must have five sentences or seven, or more, or less? Of course, such arbitrary strictures are ridiculous, and writers shouldn’t be bound by them. However, short paragraphs can be inadequate. What they may lack most is convincing detail. They’re fine for transitions, closings, and some openings, but guard against them when you need to convince. 

## Using Transitions

When you write, give logical signposts to move your reader through your statements as well. A reader should receive one message, and one message only, from the information you present. The following paragraph, delineating a problem with productivity, fails to make the necessary relationships clear. 

> Absenteeism ran about 9 percent. People would take days off without notification. Three days’ notification is required. The foreman would shut down his operation until he could either reassign employees or call someone in for overtime. Overtime costs for last year amounted to 60,000 work hours. 

Watch what happens when these ideas are joined by words that indicate their relationship to each other. Here, time and cause and effect serve as connectors. 

> *Last year* absenteeism ran about 9 percent *because* people would take days off without notification, *despite* the three-day notification requirement. *Consequently*, the foreman would shut down his operation until he could either call in or reassign someone for overtime. This pattern resulted in overtime costs amounting to 60,000 work hours. 

Even though the original paragraph contains the essential information, the rewrite is easier to read because the transitional terms signal the relationships between the facts and guide the reader along. 

Sometimes paragraphs will be purely explanatory. Then you may need words such as “because,” “in addition,” “further,” and “finally.” When a paragraph shows causal relations, you may begin with a word such as “when,” followed by information connected with “as a result,” “consequently,” or “finally.” 

Omitting transitions is never disastrous to meaning, but including them usually makes a passage more fluid and facilitates reading. Further, you may occasionally write a one-sentence paragraph that serves as a transition between key points in a document of length. 

Transition words can help you control your writing and assist the flow from idea to idea. First, assess the relationships between your ideas. Is it cause and effect? A phrase such as “as a result” clearly signals that something has resulted from some other action. If the document explains the causes or effects of some event, see that you signal your intentions by using such clear indicators as “because,” “grows out of,” or “results in.” Time sequences, similarly, should be logical: Words such as “initially,” “second,” “then,” “subsequently,” and “finally” serve to indicate chronological sequence. When these and other terms—such as “in conclusion” and “thus”—are used, make sure they signal the relations they stand for and not some vague connection you only half convey. In other words, see that each paragraph is tightly coherent in the way it connects details.
