# 3 Organizing and Delivering Information

>When we begin to write, we may anticipate the result, but writing has a way of taking on its own life.

Once you’ve identified to whom you are writing and assured yourself that your data are acceptable, consider how to put ideas and information together. This is often the most difficult part of the writing process. You may know what you need to say but may be stymied as to how to get it down on paper. This is normal; most people simply don’t like to write. There are, however, some techniques for organizing information that can help you control your ideas as you commit them to paper. Don’t be surprised, either, if you violate your initial concept of how you are going to deliver your information. The act of writing itself triggers new ideas, and this is to the good. 

Any time you create a document, look at it from two angles: logic and development of ideas. The distinctions aren’t always as neat and clear-cut as they are for the purposes of this book, however, and you may find many different ways of presenting information that work well. These guidelines are merely that: guidelines. They’ll help you control your information when you’re not sure how to present it. 

You will frequently encounter problems in organization—situations where the ideas themselves are good, but not presented in a way that makes their meaning obvious or their purpose clear. In short, how can you best organize your information so that your messages work the way they should? 

## Categorize Your Information

To effectively organize information, it helps to categorize what you are conveying— is it good? routine? negative? persuasive? If you anticipate the reader’s reaction to different categories of information, you’ll know better how to present it. Surely you wouldn’t respond to a request for an internal job transfer by saying, right off the bat, “You can’t have the job because you lack the necessary skills.” Yet, you might begin a note of recognition like this: “Congratulations, Joe. You certainly deserve this promotion.” In the first instance, the reaction would surely be more negative than you desire. In the second, the reaction will likely be as positive as you hope. You gain nothing by irritating the recipient—nor do you benefit by working up to a message of goodwill. More important, withholding information or obscuring it can have deleterious effects on the day-to-day activities that make a business run. 

>Writing is easy. All you do is sit staring at a blank sheet of paper until drops of blood form on your forehead.
>——Gene Fowler, Author

The majority of the writing you will do in the pharmaceutical industry will fall into the category of delivering routine information. For the most part, you are not eliciting an emotional response; you are presenting information your readers need to have. Use these guidelines for logical presentation. But remember: They are not cast in stone. 

Finally, writing isn’t easy. Nothing says you have to “begin at the beginning and go to the end.” You may be best off getting the details down and then rearranging them for readability and comprehension. 

### The Direct Approach

>I hate to write, but I love having written.
>——Dorothy Parker, Author

Use this pattern for presenting most of the information you relay in writing. The direct approach is effective for routine information— the work-specific writing you do. When you are writing a short memo or technical note, for instance, let this pattern govern your total delivery of information. When you are writing a document of length, break it into segments, and use this pattern to help you control your overall delivery as well as your delivery in each part.

The direct approach calls for making the key point first. This way, your reader will immediately know what a document, or portion of a document, is about. Your point logically leads to information that supports it. Unfortunately, when most people write about what they’ve done or what they’re going to do, they tend to approach documenting the past or projecting future activity sequentially, the way they have addressed or will address completion of the task itself. Writing sequentially seems logical, and indeed, it reflects inductive reasoning: A series of facts leads to a conclusion. However, the reader is best served by understanding the point first—whether it is a summary of findings, a strategic decision, or the results of an investigation. 

Usually, delaying the point doesn’t make a document any more effective. Your reader does not know the purpose of a document the way you did before you even began to write it. Thus, inductive presentation is not the best way for most readers to receive information. With inductive presentation the reader doesn’t get the point until he reaches at the end of a document or passage in a document. Readers understand messages best when a point is followed by a series of facts that support the point. 

For instance, by the time an engineer prepares a summary of an installation/ operation qualification (IQ/OQ), she has been working on the project for a long time. She has already written a protocol of what she planned to do and has secured the necessary approval. Then she’s gone through the testing process. Chances are, she may have had some nonconformances along the way. Once she’s assured herself the equipment installation and operation meet qualification criteria for the company’s needs-specific purposes, she has gone through a step-by-step process. 

Yet there’s no benefit in preparing a report for approval of the qualification by saying, “In July it was time to requalify the 200-gallon batching kettle with double motion counterrotating agitator” and then detailing events chronologically. What the readers need here is an immediate statement that asserts that the equipment is qualified, partially qualified, or not qualified as a result of the testing according to the protocol. An IQ/OQ summary report is easy to understand when it begins straightforwardly like this: 

The Lee Industries 200-gallon batching kettle with double motion counterrotating agitator meets all the installation/operation qualification requirements. All test functions established in Protocol Q023 are complete and reconciled. In carrying out the testing, we addressed three nonconformances. All test results are attached. 

>If you have an important point to make, don’t try to be subtle or clever. Use a pile driver. Hit the point once. Then come back and hit it again. Then hit it a third time—a tremendous whack.
>——Winston Churchill

The summary report then can go on to explain nonconformances and their impacts and state requirements for scheduled requalification and so forth. This way, the readers know immediately the results of the qualification testing and are ready for what the report contains. Here’s a basic pattern for presenting information: 

The beginning:								State your purpose. What point do you want your reader to know?
										 				 What, if anything, do you want your reader to do?

The supporting information:	   Offer details to substantiate your purpose.

The close:										Tell your reader what he or she needs to know to be convinced.
														  Restate the point or call for action.

The information in this short memo isn’t as effective as it could be because it doesn’t make its point up front. The reader is subject to explanatory details before learning the purpose of the communication.
