Once you’ve identified to whom you are writing and assured yourself that your data are acceptable, consider how to put ideas and information together. This is often the most difficult part of the writing process. You may know what you need to say but may be stymied as to how to get it down on paper. This is normal; most people simply don’t like to write. There are, however, some techniques for organizing information that can help you control your ideas as you commit them to paper. Don’t be surprised, either, if you violate your initial concept of how you are going to deliver your information. The act of writing itself triggers new ideas, and this is to the good. 

一旦您确定了写作的对象，并确保您的数据可接受，考虑如何将想法和信息组织起来。这通常是写作过程中最困难的部分。您可能知道您需要说什么，但可能不知道如何将其写下来。这是正常的；大多数人只是不喜欢写作。然而，有一些组织信息的技巧可以帮助您在将其写到纸上时控制您的想法。同时，如果您违背了最初的传递信息的概念，也不要感到惊讶。写作本身会触发新的想法，这对您有好处。

Any time you create a document, look at it from two angles: logic and development of ideas. The distinctions aren’t always as neat and clear-cut as they are for the purposes of this book, however, and you may find many different ways of presenting information that work well. These guidelines are merely that: guidelines. They’ll help you control your information when you’re not sure how to present it. 

每当您创建一份文件时，从两个角度来看：逻辑和思想的发展。然而，这些区别并不总是像本书的目的那样干净明确，您可能会发现很多不同的信息呈现方式效果都不错。这些准则只是指导原则。当您不确定如何展示信息时，它们将帮助您控制信息。

You will frequently encounter problems in organization—situations where the ideas themselves are good, but not presented in a way that makes their meaning obvious or their purpose clear. In short, how can you best organize your information so that your messages work the way they should? 

您经常会遇到组织上的问题——情况是，想法本身很好，但并没有以使其意义明显或目的清晰的方式展示。简而言之，您如何才能最好地组织信息，使您的信息能够达到预期的效果？

## Categorize Your Information 将信息分类

To effectively organize information, it helps to categorize what you are conveying— is it good? routine? negative? persuasive? If you anticipate the reader’s reaction to different categories of information, you’ll know better how to present it. Surely you wouldn’t respond to a request for an internal job transfer by saying, right off the bat, “You can’t have the job because you lack the necessary skills.” Yet, you might begin a note of recognition like this: “Congratulations, Joe. You certainly deserve this promotion.” In the first instance, the reaction would surely be more negative than you desire. In the second, the reaction will likely be as positive as you hope. You gain nothing by irritating the recipient—nor do you benefit by working up to a message of goodwill. More important, withholding information or obscuring it can have deleterious effects on the day-to-day activities that make a business run. 

为了有效地组织信息，帮助将您要传达的内容进行分类——这是好消息？例行信息？负面信息？还是说服性信息？如果您能预先预测读者对不同类别信息的反应，您就会更好地知道如何展示它。当然，您不会对内部调岗的请求作出这样的回应：“你没有必要的技能，你不能得到这个职位。”然而，您可以这样开始一封表彰信：“祝贺你，乔。你当之无愧地得到了晋升。”在第一种情况下，反应肯定会比您期望的更为消极。在第二种情况下，反应可能会像您希望的那样积极。刺激收件人并不会给您带来任何好处，以及使信息模糊不清可能对推动企业日常运营产生不良影响。

>Writing is easy. All you do is sit staring at a blank sheet of paper until drops of blood form on your forehead.

>——Gene Fowler, Author

The majority of the writing you will do in the pharmaceutical industry will fall into the category of delivering routine information. For the most part, you are not eliciting an emotional response; you are presenting information your readers need to have. Use these guidelines for logical presentation. But remember: They are not cast in stone. 

在制药行业中，您将要完成的大部分写作工作都属于例行信息的传递。在大多数情况下，您不是在引起情绪反应；您是在向读者呈现他们需要了解的信息。请使用这些逻辑呈现的准则。但请记住：它们并非一成不变。

Finally, writing isn’t easy. Nothing says you have to “begin at the beginning and go to the end.” You may be best off getting the details down and then rearranging them for readability and comprehension. 

最后，写作并不容易。没有人规定您必须“从头开始，一直写到结尾”。您最好先记录详细信息，然后再对其进行重新组织，以提高可读性和理解性。

### The Direct Approach 直接方法

>I hate to write, but I love having written.
>
>我痛恨写作，但我喜欢完成时的感觉。
>
>——Dorothy Parker, Author

Use this pattern for presenting most of the information you relay in writing. The direct approach is effective for routine information— the work-specific writing you do. When you are writing a short memo or technical note, for instance, let this pattern govern your total delivery of information. When you are writing a document of length, break it into segments, and use this pattern to help you control your overall delivery as well as your delivery in each part.

在书写中，使用这种模式来呈现大多数信息。直接方法对于例行信息非常有效——您所做的与工作相关的写作。例如，当您写一封简短的备忘录或技术说明时，让这种模式来主导您整体信息的传递。当您写一份较长的文件时，将其拆分成若干部分，并使用这种模式来帮助您控制整体信息的传递，以及每个部分的传递。

The direct approach calls for making the key point first. This way, your reader will immediately know what a document, or portion of a document, is about. Your point logically leads to information that supports it. Unfortunately, when most people write about what they’ve done or what they’re going to do, they tend to approach documenting the past or projecting future activity sequentially, the way they have addressed or will address completion of the task itself. Writing sequentially seems logical, and indeed, it reflects inductive reasoning: A series of facts leads to a conclusion. However, the reader is best served by understanding the point first—whether it is a summary of findings, a strategic decision, or the results of an investigation. 

直接方法要求首先阐明关键观点。这样，您的读者会立即知道一份文件或一部分文件的主题是什么。您的观点会逻辑性地引导到支持它的信息。不幸的是，当大多数人写关于他们所做或即将做的事情时，他们倾向于按照时间顺序进行文档化，就像他们处理或将要处理任务本身的完成一样。逐步写作似乎是合乎逻辑的，而且确实反映了归纳推理：一系列事实导致一个结论。然而，读者最好是先了解要点——无论是调查结果摘要，战略决策还是调查结果。

Usually, delaying the point doesn’t make a document any more effective. Your reader does not know the purpose of a document the way you did before you even began to write it. Thus, inductive presentation is not the best way for most readers to receive information. With inductive presentation the reader doesn’t get the point until he reaches at the end of a document or passage in a document. Readers understand messages best when a point is followed by a series of facts that support the point. 

通常情况下，推迟阐明观点不会使文档更加有效。读者在开始写作之前不知道文档的目的，所以对于大多数读者来说，归纳性的呈现方式并不是接收信息的最佳方式。在归纳性呈现方式下，读者直到他在文档结尾或文档的一部分末尾才明白观点。当观点后面跟着一系列支持观点的事实时，读者更容易理解信息。

For instance, by the time an engineer prepares a summary of an installation/ operation qualification (IQ/OQ), she has been working on the project for a long time. She has already written a protocol of what she planned to do and has secured the necessary approval. Then she’s gone through the testing process. Chances are, she may have had some nonconformances along the way. Once she’s assured herself the equipment installation and operation meet qualification criteria for the company’s needs-specific purposes, she has gone through a step-by-step process. 

例如，当一名工程师准备一个装置/运行资格（IQ/OQ）的摘要时，她已经在项目上工作了很长时间。她已经撰写了计划要做的事情的方案，并获得了必要的批准。然后她经过了测试过程。很有可能，她在过程中遇到了一些不符合要求的情况。一旦她确认设备的安装和操作符合公司特定目的的资格标准，她就经历了一个逐步的过程。

Yet there’s no benefit in preparing a report for approval of the qualification by saying, “In July it was time to requalify the 200-gallon batching kettle with double motion counterrotating agitator” and then detailing events chronologically. What the readers need here is an immediate statement that asserts that the equipment is qualified, partially qualified, or not qualified as a result of the testing according to the protocol. An IQ/OQ summary report is easy to understand when it begins straightforwardly like this: 

然而，在准备一份报告以获得资格批准时，没有好处来说：“在七月份是时候重新对双运动逆向旋转搅拌器的200加仑配料釜进行资格认证”然后按事件顺序详细描述。读者在这里需要的是一个直接陈述，断言设备是经过测试合格、部分合格还是不合格的，根据协议进行的测试。IQ/OQ摘要报告可以采用以下简单直接的方式进行：

The Lee Industries 200-gallon batching kettle with double motion counterrotating agitator meets all the installation/operation qualification requirements. All test functions established in Protocol Q023 are complete and reconciled. In carrying out the testing, we addressed three nonconformances. All test results are attached. 

Lee工业公司的200加仑混料釜，配备双重运动的反转搅拌器，符合所有安装/操作资格要求。所有在Q023协议中设立的测试功能都已经完成并得到了统一。在测试过程中，我们处理了三个不符合项。所有测试结果附在附件中。

>If you have an important point to make, don’t try to be subtle or clever. Use a pile driver. Hit the point once. Then come back and hit it again. Then hit it a third time—a tremendous whack.
>
>如果你有重要的观点要表达，不要试图委婉或聪明。使用打桩机。一次击中要点。然后回来再击中一次。然后第三次击中——猛烈地。
>
>——Winston Churchill

The summary report then can go on to explain nonconformances and their impacts and state requirements for scheduled requalification and so forth. This way, the readers know immediately the results of the qualification testing and are ready for what the report contains. Here’s a basic pattern for presenting information: 

接下来，总结报告将解释不符合项及其影响，并说明定期重新资格认证等要求。这样，读者立即了解了资格认证测试的结果，并做好准备阅读报告的内容。以下是呈现信息的基本模式：

The beginning:								State your purpose. What point do you want your reader to know?

开头部分										  阐明你的目的。你希望读者了解什么观点？

 						 				               What, if anything, do you want your reader to do?

​														如果需要，你希望读者采取什么行动？

The supporting information:	   Offer details to substantiate your purpose.

支持信息部分：								提供详细信息来支持你的目的。

The close:										Tell your reader what he or she needs to know to be convinced.
														  Restate the point or call for action.

结尾部分：										告诉读者他们需要了解的内容以确信或重申观点，或者呼吁采取行动。

        我们决定将硫酸奎宁 200 毫克胶囊的剂量与 325 毫克的剂量成正比。 对于硫酸奎宁 200 毫克胶囊，我们一直使用 2 号胶囊和 100 cc 容量的瓶子。
    </p>
    <p>
        However, the number 2 size capsules are inadequate for the 325 mg dose. Therefore we decided to use the number 1 size capsules. Then we determined it to be too difficult to accommodate one hundred number1 size capsules in the 100 cc bottle along with the insert. We also realized that 100 number 1 size capsules and the insert would be difficult to fit into the 100 cc bottle. To accommodate the new capsules, we changed the bottle size from 100 cc to 150 cc and added rayon to fill the empty space on top of the capsules. This solution is satisfactory, and we have changed our packaging specifications accordingly. 
    </p>
    <p>
        但是，2号尺寸的胶囊不适合325毫克的剂量。因此，我们决定使用1号尺寸的胶囊。然后我们发现在100毫升瓶子中容纳100粒1号尺寸的胶囊和说明书非常困难。我们也意识到100粒1号尺寸的胶囊和说明书很难装入100毫升的瓶子中。为了适应新的胶囊，我们将瓶子的大小从100毫升更改为150毫升，并在胶囊顶部加入人造丝以填充空白空间。这个解决方案是令人满意的，我们相应地更改了我们的包装标准。

Even though this memo is short, it’s easier to understand when the key idea comes first. The point is not to explain the decision to make the capsules dose proportional to 325 mg, but to detail the consequences and subsequent decisions about packaging. In the following version, the reader reasonably looks to the information after the first statement to back up that statement, and it does. 

即使这份备忘录很短，但当关键想法首先出现时，更容易理解。重点不是解释将胶囊按照325毫克进行配比的决定，而是详细说明包装方面的后果和随后的决定。在以下版本中，读者合理地期待在第一句话之后的信息来支持该观点，而它的确做到了。

    <p>
        Dear Wholesaler/Retailer尊敬的批发商/零售商：:
    </p>
    <p>
        Recent tests indicate that some outstanding lots of 50 mg suppositories do not meet minimum assay requirements through their expiration dates. Because we are uncertain that all lots will meet assay requirements throughout their shelf life, we are recalling all unexpired lots of this product. These lots have potency assays ranging from 59% to 100%. In addition, we have been unable to identify a degradation product; the concentration levels are unknown. This represents a potential health hazard, but we believe that the probability of serious adverse health consequences is remote. 
    </p>
    <p>
         最近的测试表明，某些尚未销售的50毫克栓剂批次在其有效期内未能满足最低的检测要求。由于我们不确定所有批次在货架期内是否满足检测要求，我们正在召回所有未过期的该产品批次。这些批次的效价检测结果范围在59%至100%之间。此外，我们无法确认降解产物的存在，其浓度水平是未知的。虽然这可能存在潜在的健康风险，但我们相信严重不良的健康后果的可能性是很小的。
    </p>
    <p>
        Please determine if you have any lots on hand. If you do, discontinue distribution of these lots and return the merchandise to our facility promptly, to my attention. Please complete and return the enclosed response form as well. If you have any questions call 306-123-4567, extension 525. 
    </p>
        <p>
         请确认您手头是否有任何受影响的批次。如果有，请立即停止销售这些批次，并将货物及时退回至我们的设施，并标注我的名字。同时请填写并退回随附的回复表格。如有任何疑问，请拨打电话306-123-4567，分机525。
    </p>
    <p>
        If you have distributed any of these lots, please contact your accounts immediately; advise them of the recall; and have them return their outstanding recalled stocks to you. We are conducting this recall to the retail/dispensing level. Return these stocks as indicated above. We will reimburse you by credit memo for the returned goods and postage. 
    </p>
    <p>
        如果您已经销售了任何这些批次，请立即联系您的客户；告知他们此次召回，并要求他们将受影响的存货退还给您。我们将此次召回扩展到零售/发药层面。请按照上述指示退还这些库存。我们将通过贷记备忘录为您退还货品和邮费。

### The Direct Approach in Report Sections 直接方法在报告部分的应用

You can apply the same principles of delivery in segments of reports. Even if a report has a clean, comprehensive summary at the beginning, the information within each component of the document is easier to comprehend when it makes a point and logically supports it. 

您可以将信息传递的同样原则应用于报告的各个部分。即使报告的开头有一个干净、全面的摘要，当每个组成部分的信息直接阐述并有逻辑支持时，读者更容易理解。

The following is a portion of a product development report. The point is to identify which batch the company will use as the standard to manufacture a product. Notice that the writer has delivered the information in the sequence in which it occurred. Where does the information the reader wants to know lie? 

以下是产品开发报告的一部分。目的是确定公司将使用哪一批作为生产产品的标准。请注意，作者在按照时间顺序提供了信息。读者希望知道的信息位于哪里？

The very last sentence is what the readers want to know. All the information is here—but a simple revision, almost a cut and paste, makes this information easier to digest. Since the key information rests in the last paragraph, moving that information to the beginning both clarifies and allows for logical explanation of what follows. A simple edit to paragraph two and a brief statement of closure completes this section of the development report. 

最后一句是读者想要知道的内容。所有信息都在这里，但简单地进行修改，几乎是剪贴粘贴，使得这些信息更易于理解。由于关键信息位于最后一段，将该信息移到开头既清晰又有逻辑地解释了后续内容。对第二段进行简单的编辑和简短的结尾陈述就完成了开发报告的这部分内容。

### Good News 好消息

>Reading makes a full man, conference a ready man, and writing an exact man.阅读使人充实，交谈使人机敏，写作使人精确。
>——Francis Bacon

For most documentation purposes, you will deliver information most effectively using the direct approach. Sometimes, however, you may need to deliver information that is not directly linked to documentation, but serves to drive everyday activities. You will find that the direct approach works well for good news, too. People, of course, like to receive good news, and when you make your point up front, your readers are much more likely to absorb the details that reinforce the positive point. The following memorandum from a company president announces the appointment of three people to company positions. It follows this pattern: 

对于大多数文档目的，您可以使用直接方法最有效地传达信息。但有时，您可能需要传递与文件不直接相关，但用于推动日常活动的信息。您会发现，对于好消息，直接方法也非常有效。当您首先传递好消息时，读者更有可能吸收细节，加强积极的观点。以下是一封公司总裁的备忘录，宣布了三人的公司职位任命。其遵循以下模式：

Paragraph one: States the good news

第一段：宣布好消息

Paragraph two: Gives details about Gary Williams

第二段：介绍Gary Williams的详细情况

Paragraph three: Gives details about Christian Matthews

第三段：介绍Christian Matthews的详细情况

Paragraph four: Gives details about Stan Syvertsen

第四段：介绍Stan Syvertsen的详细情况

Paragraph five: Closes on a friendly note

第五段：友好地结束信件

### Indirect Approach 间接方法

While this book advocates the direct approach as the primary pattern for delivery of information for documentation, sometimes you may find the indirect approach more appropriate. The indirect approach calls for presenting information that leads to a point. 

尽管本书主张直接方法作为文档信息传递的主要模式，但有时候你可能会发现间接方法更加合适。间接方法要求以引导性信息来呈现信息，逐步引导读者到达一个观点。

This pattern is useful for certain information. Reports like investigations typically deliver a sequence of events, an assessment, and a plan for action. And less-than-positive information works best when the negative news is delayed a bit. 

这种模式适用于特定类型的信息。例如，调查报告通常提供一系列事件、评估和行动计划。在传递不太积极的信息时，稍稍推迟负面消息会更加有效。

### Negative News 负面消息

If you are in a position to determine the suitability of contract manufacturers or suppliers, for instance, you may on occasion have to deliver negative news. Suppose you determine an outside laboratory’s testing standards have deteriorated and you wish to stop employing the services, at least temporarily, until the laboratory can improve its standards. In such a case, the indirect approach may work well. You can reasonably explain your position before you state it. This provides a better opportunity for retaining goodwill should circumstances change in the future and you wish to reestablish business relations. 

如果你在决定合同制造商或供应商的适用性时，有时可能不得不传递负面消息。例如，假设你发现一个外部实验室的测试标准已经下降，你可能希望暂时停止使用该实验室的服务，直到其改善标准为止。在这种情况下，间接方法可能更合适。你可以在陈述观点之前合理地解释你的立场。这样，如果未来情况发生变化，你希望重新建立业务关系，更容易保持良好的商业关系。

Delivering negative news is never easy. People naturally hesitate to come right out and state the message they know will be ill-received, particularly if they wish to retain goodwill. But at times, people do have to bear bad news. This letter to a production team provides a paradigm for delivering bad news: 

传递负面消息从来都不容易。人们自然而然地不愿意直接陈述他们知道会受到拒绝的消息，尤其是如果他们希望保持友好关系。但有时候，人们不得不传递不好的消息。以下是给生产团队的一封信，为传递坏消息提供了一个范例：

Paragraph one: Presents mutually agreeable information 

第一段：呈现共同认可的信息

Paragraph two: Offers explanatory details that lead to the main point, states the point, and offers more information

第二段：提供解释性细节，引导到主要观点，陈述观点，并提供更多信息 

Paragraph three: Offers further explanation, as appropriate 

第三段：提供必要的进一步解释

Paragraph four: Closes on a positive note 

第四段：以积极的态度结尾

       <b>TO:</b> All Employees 全体员工 
    </p>

        <b>DATE:</b> March 21, 2005

        <b>FROM:</b> Ingvald Landrud
    </p>
    <b>RE:</b> Third Shift Notice 三班轮班通知
    <p>
        We appreciate the dedicated efforts of all of you on the third shift. You have been a vital part of our production activities and an integral part of Lyngdal Laboratories.
    </p>
    <p>
        我们非常感谢所有三班轮班员工的辛勤付出。你们一直是我们生产活动的重要一环，也是Lyngdal Laboratories不可或缺的一部分。
    </p>
    <p>
        However, we have lost two significant accounts to competitors who can offer more rapid production because of a significantly smaller product line overall, and newer facilities. That’s why we must temporarily suspend our third shift activities while we modernize our packaging equipment to be competitive. You will, of course, receive unemployment compensation and other benefits to which you are entitled. Your supervisors will further explain the impact of our temporary suspension of the third shift and direct you to any additional assistance you may need during this period. 
    </p>
    <p>
        然而，由于竞争对手能够因其更小的产品线整体规模以及更新的设施而提供更快的生产，我们失去了两个重要客户。因此，在我们现代化我们的包装设备以保持竞争力的过程中，我们必须暂时暂停我们的三班轮班活动。你们当然会收到应有的失业补偿和其他福利待遇。你们的主管将进一步解释我们临时停止三班轮班对你们的影响，并在此期间指导你们寻求任何额外的帮助。
    </p>
    <p>
        We hope to resume production as quickly as possible; we do not anticipate a prolonged work cessation. We will notify you of shift resumption at the earliest practical time.
    </p>
    <p>
        我们希望尽快恢复生产；我们不预期工作停止会持续很长时间。我们会在最早的实际时间通知你们班次恢复的情况。
    </p>
    <p>
        In the meantime, please be reassured. This work suspension in no way reflects negatively on the performance of the third shift. We will make every effort to resume production as quickly as possible, and we hope to have you there on the team when it does.
    </p>
    <p>
        与此同时，请放心。这次工作暂停绝不会对三班轮班的表现产生负面影响。我们会尽一切努力尽快恢复生产，希望你们在恢复生产时仍然能够加入团队。
    </p>

### Persuasion 劝说

>Whatever we well understand, we express clearly, and words flow with ease.
>
>我们对于我们理解透彻的事物会表达得清晰明了，言辞会流畅自如。
>
>——Nicholas Boileau

On the occasion when you need to ask a favor of someone but anticipate a negative response, use an indirect pattern. Bear in mind that most requests are routine and the direct approach will suffice. A contractor or vendor, for instance, is generally happy to supply a response to a request. Using the indirect approach, however, will help you when you need to convince someone to take action, to respond to a request when you anticipate the initial reaction may be negative. It’s human nature to be happy to be asked but reluctant to comply. Consider asking someone to speak at a professional meeting, for example. Most people hate, more than anything, to speak in front of a group. So, in this case, the reader might be flattered but reply negatively, which is not what you want.

当你需要向某人请求一个恩惠，但预计会得到负面回应时，可以使用一种间接的模式。请记住，大多数请求都是例行公事，直接的方法足够了。例如，承包商或供应商通常很乐意对请求做出回应。然而，在你需要说服某人采取行动，对请求做出回应时，可以使用间接方法，特别是当你预计最初的反应可能是负面的。人的天性是喜欢被人提问，但不愿意服从。以请某人在专业会议上发言为例。大多数人最不愿意做的事情，就是在人群前演讲。所以，在这种情况下，读者可能会受宠若惊，但回应会是消极的，这并不是你想要的结果。

>Make everything as simple as possible, but not simpler.
>
>使一切尽可能简单，但不要过于简化。
>
>——Albert Einstein

What’s likely to happen here is this: The recipient will read as far as the second sentence, and his mind will say “no way.” Even though the second paragraph recognizes the reader’s expertise, he has already mentally responded to the request made in the first—very likely negatively. Reworking the request so that interest develops first makes this letter much more effective.

这里可能会发生的情况是：收信人会读到第二句话，然后心里会说“不可能”。尽管第二段承认了读者的专业知识，但他已经在第一句中对请求做出了心理回应，很可能是负面的。通过重新组织请求，使兴趣首先产生，可以使这封信变得更加有效。

### Uniting the Direct and Indirect Approaches 直接与间接方法的结合

Many documents, especially reports of length, combine the direct and indirect approaches for delivering information effectively. For instance, a technical report may begin with a summary that states the main idea in the first sentence and cites key points to follow. Individual sections then present information that supports those points. Some sections in the report may provide information sequentially, particularly if they discuss procedures or events leading up to a current position.

许多文件，特别是较长的报告，将直接和间接方法结合起来，以有效地传递信息。例如，技术报告可能以摘要开始，第一句就陈述主要观点并引用后续的关键要点。然后各个章节会呈现支持这些要点的信息。报告中的一些部分可能会按顺序提供信息，特别是如果它们讨论了导致当前位置的程序或事件。

A Standard Operating Procedure (SOP), for example, uses a mixed pattern of delivery. A purpose or objective statement tells at a glance what the document is about—and the reader is prepared for the sequential steps that will lead to completion of the task.

例如，标准操作规程（SOP）使用了混合的交付模式。目的或目标陈述在一瞥之间就告诉读者文档内容是什么，读者会准备好接下来将会引导完成任务的步骤。

## Using an Outline 使用大纲

Many writers wouldn’t venture into the murky waters of writing without an outline, yet outlines aren’t for everybody. An outline may indeed help chart your course and serve as your guide as you develop your document, particularly if it is lengthy. But there are some cautionary notes here. While outlines can help, they can also defeat if they prevent you from exploring an innovative idea triggered by the writing process. If you prefer to use an outline, use it as a guide, not a mandate. Some writers work best with no outlines; they impose structure as the document progresses. Still others prefer a rigid outline, which will work for those who do a great deal of mental mulling before they write. Still others work best with a loosely defined outline that expands and contracts as the document takes form. Which method you adopt depends on you as a writer. There’s no “must do” here—it’s a matter of discovering what works best for you. 

许多作家在进行写作时都会使用大纲，然而，并不是每个人都适合使用大纲。的确，大纲可以帮助规划你的写作路线，在你拓展文档内容时充当指南，特别是在写作较长文档时。但这里有一些警示。尽管大纲可以帮助，但如果它们阻止你探索由写作过程引发的创新思路，它们也可能起到反效果。如果你喜欢使用大纲，将其作为指导而非命令。一些作家在没有大纲的情况下表现最佳；他们会在文档逐渐进展的过程中确定结构。还有一些人更喜欢严格的大纲，这对于那些在写作之前经过深思熟虑的人非常有效。另一些人则更适合使用一个松散定义的大纲，随着文档的形成而扩展和收缩。你采取的方法取决于你作为一个作家。这里没有“必须做”的规定，而是要发现什么对你最有效。

## Developing Paragraphs 发展段落

Think of each paragraph you write as a mini-piece of documentation. Generally, give each idea its own paragraph and provide enough information to convince. You can use the direct or indirect approach for your paragraphs as well, depending on the message you want to deliver. In most instances, each paragraph should have one sentence that states the controlling idea. The other sentences should provide proof to support that idea.

把你写的每个段落都当作一个小型的文档片段。通常，为每个观点单独分配一个段落，并提供足够的信息来进行说明。你在段落中可以采用直接或间接的方法，具体取决于你想传达的信息。在大多数情况下，每个段落应该有一个陈述主题的句子。其他句子应该提供证据来支持这个主题。

### Starting with the Controlling Idea 以主控观点开始

You can present information clearly using the direct approach in individual paragraphs. When you give your readers the controlling idea first, they will be receptive to receiving what is next. The following paragraph discusses a two-tier team effort, and the first sentence sets the stage. 

你可以在单独的段落中使用直接方法来清晰地呈现信息。当你首先给读者一个主控观点，他们会愿意接受接下来的内容。以下段落讨论了一个两层次的团队合作，第一句设置了背景。

> Instituting a program of production equipment maintenance at Ronway Laboratories requires a two-tier team effort. A core team of Maintenance and Engineering employees trained in the aspects of TQM should form the first-tier team, with one employee serving as group leader. Each member of the core team, in turn, will assume responsibility for directing a team in developing the maintenance program for a specific piece of equipment or group of equipment. The intent is to impart “ownership” of the equipment maintenance to designated teams. 
>
> 在Ronway实验室引入生产设备维护计划需要一个两层次的团队合作。第一层次的团队应由受过TQM培训的维护和工程员组成，其中一名员工担任小组领导。核心团队的每个成员，依次将负责指导一个团队制定特定设备或一组设备的维护计划。目标是将设备维护的“所有权”赋予指定的团队成员。

Sometimes one controlling sentence can carry more than one paragraph of explanatory information. This is a call you must make. The following paragraph is from an information report generated when a company decided to purchase a new mixer for making a topical product. While it does the job, it is lengthy, with several ideas that support the first sentence, and offers the reader no chance to pause while absorbing the information. 

有时一个主控句子可以承载多个段落的解释性信息。这是你必须做出的决定。以下段落来自一份信息报告，该报告是在一家公司决定购买新的混合机用于制作外用产品时生成的。尽管这段信息是为了完成任务，但长度较长，有几个支持第一句的观点，读者在吸收信息时没有停顿的机会。

> The mixer we purchase must be suitable for our needs. The shape of the mixer and the rigidity of the blades, as well as the effectiveness of scrapers, are primary concerns. Since thorough and consistent scraping of the mixer walls is vital to blend uniformity, internal surfaces must be accessible to receive adequate scraping so that residual material does not become part of the batch and result in nonuniformity. The scraper blades must be rigid enough to effectively scrape the walls, but not so much so as to damage the walls. Another concern is mixing capability; inadequate mixing that permits portions of the batch to remain stationary can result in “dead spots.” Overly rigid mixer blades may provide good mixing, but impede scraping. Blades with too much flexibility, on the other hand, may not effectively mix a formula with the viscosity of ours. Blades should therefore be of a firm plastic that will provide adequate mixing and permit scraping of mixer walls during processing without damaging the interior surface. 
>
> 我们购买的混合机必须适合我们的需求。混合机的形状、刀片的刚度以及刮板的效果是主要的考虑因素。由于对混合均匀性至关重要，彻底且一致的刮擦混合机壁是必需的，内部表面必须可以接受充分的刮擦，以使残留物不成为批次的一部分，从而导致不均匀性。刮刀刀片必须足够坚固，可以有效地刮擦壁面，但不能太过坚固，以免损坏壁面。另一个问题是混合能力；不充分的混合会导致批次中的某些部分保持静止，形成“死角”。过于刚硬的混合刀片可能会提供良好的混合效果，但会阻碍刮擦。另一方面，过于灵活的刀片可能无法有效地混合我们的粘度公式。因此，刀片应该采用坚固的塑料，既可以在处理过程中提供充分的混合，又可以在刮擦混合机壁时不损坏内部表面。

Readability improves dramatically when this lengthy passage is broken into two paragraphs, both controlled by the first sentence in the first paragraph. 

当将这段较长的内容分为两个段落，并由第一个段落的第一句来控制两个段落时，可显著提高可读性。

> The mixer we purchase must be suitable for our needs. The shape of the mixer and the rigidity of the blades, as well as the effectiveness of scrapers, are primary concerns.

### Leading to a Conclusion 引导至结论

Often a paragraph, such as the following one, offers a series of details that lead to a conclusion. This paragraph, from an out-of-specification (OOS) report, details a series of events; it is a causal presentation of information. The result of an OOS investigation is the main point of the paragraph, and it comes last. 

通常，一个段落会提供一系列细节，引导到一个结论。以下这个段落来自一个不合规（OOS）报告，详细描述了一系列事件，它是一种因果关系的呈现方式。OOS调查的结果是这个段落的主要观点，它位于最后。

> As soon as the microbiologicial out-of-specification result occurred, the analyst notified the supervisor. The supervisor then authorized a second analyst to retest the original laboratory sample using a sample triple the size of the original. While the analyst retested the sample, the supervisor reviewed all documentation relative to the OOS. The retest failed to isolate the aberrant data and verified the original result. Analyst error, technical malfunction, and media contamination were ruled out, and an assignable cause proved to be inconclusive. The supervisor notified QA, and QA subsequently rejected the batch. 
>
> 一旦出现微生物超出规范的结果，分析员立即通知了主管。然后，主管授权第二名分析员使用原样本的三倍大小重新测试原始实验室样本。当分析员重新测试样本时，主管审查了与OOS有关的所有文件。再次测试未能分离出异常数据并验证了原始结果。分析员错误、技术故障和培养基污染被排除在外，而可归因的原因则被证明是没有定论的。主管通知了质量保证部门，随后质量保证部门拒绝了这批次。

The following paragraph effectively cites a condition first, with an explanation of subsequent action. 

以下这个段落以条件为前提，解释了随后的行动。

> QC discovered that the in-house HPLC/2323/ASI Revision 3 analyses of the related compounds tests were flawed, and the results are invalid. The lot involved was L211; the test stations were one-month accelerated and three-month accelerated. QC corrected the problem at the nine month test station. As a result, the 12-month test station results are valid, and the 12-month results show that all the room temperature samples are within specification. 
>
> 质量控制发现，内部的HPLC/2323/ASI修订版3的相关化合物测试分析存在缺陷，结果是无效的。涉及的批次是L211；测试站点分别是一个月加速和三个月加速。质量控制在九个月的测试站点纠正了这个问题。因此，12个月的测试站点结果是有效的，12个月的结果显示所有室温样品都在规范范围内。

### Giving Adequate Information 提供充分的信息

Even if you organize your information appropriately, your paragraphs may somehow lack the essential ingredients for convincing your reader. This problem is often one of idea development. Ideas need to be spelled out, or enhanced in such a way that they elicit the right response from the reader. 即使您已经适当地组织了您的信息，您的段落可能还是缺少能够说服读者的基本要素。这个问题通常是思想发展的问题。思想需要被详细阐述，或以一种能够引发读者正确反应的方式加强。

The following paragraph from a chemical hygiene plan would benefit from more detail.

以下是来自化学安全计划的段落，如果加入更多的细节会更有益

> Hot glassware can be dangerous. Be careful when handling it.
>
> 热玻璃器皿可能很危险。在处理它时要小心。

Why is hot glassware dangerous? What can laboratory personnel do to minimize the danger? What do they need to do? A good directive includes the answers to questions such as these. Consider this rewrite:

为什么热玻璃器皿是危险的？实验室人员可以采取什么措施来降低危险？他们需要做什么？一个好的指导应该包括回答这些问题。考虑以下的改写：

> Take care when removing glassware from heat since hot glassware can cause severe burns. Never attempt to hold hot glassware without adequate protection, because the item can fall and break, causing hot liquids to splatter. Use asbestos gloves or appropriate tongs. Use utility tongs to handle small apparatus and crucibles, and beaker tongs to hold and carry small beakers. 
>
> 在取下热玻璃器皿时要小心，因为热玻璃器皿可能会造成严重烫伤。千万不要试图不使用足够的保护措施来持有热玻璃器皿，因为物品可能会掉下并破裂，导致热液体溅出。使用石棉手套或适当的夹子。使用工具夹子来处理小装置和坩埚，使用烧杯夹来持有和携带小烧杯。

This rewrite has the strength of focusing on concrete specifics in an orderly way, and it provides thorough coverage of a procedure. Remember when English teachers told you that paragraphs must have five sentences or seven, or more, or less? Of course, such arbitrary strictures are ridiculous, and writers shouldn’t be bound by them. However, short paragraphs can be inadequate. What they may lack most is convincing detail. They’re fine for transitions, closings, and some openings, but guard against them when you need to convince. 

这个改写的优点在于有条理地聚焦于具体细节，并且对流程进行了全面的覆盖。还记得英语老师曾经告诉过你，段落必须有五句话、七句话，或者更多、更少吗？当然，这样的武断规定是荒谬的，作家不应受其限制。然而，短段落可能是不充分的。它们适用于过渡、结束和一些开头，但在需要说服的情况下要注意避免使用它们。

## Using Transitions 使用过渡词

When you write, give logical signposts to move your reader through your statements as well. A reader should receive one message, and one message only, from the information you present. The following paragraph, delineating a problem with productivity, fails to make the necessary relationships clear. 

当你写作时，还要给读者提供逻辑指示，以便顺利引导他们穿越你的陈述。读者应该从你所呈现的信息中获得一个，而且只有一个，主要信息。以下段落描述了一个生产力问题，但没有清楚地表达出必要的关系。

> Absenteeism ran about 9 percent. People would take days off without notification. Three days’ notification is required. The foreman would shut down his operation until he could either reassign employees or call someone in for overtime. Overtime costs for last year amounted to 60,000 work hours. 
>
> 旷工率约为9%。人们会没有提前通知就请假。需要提前三天通知。工头会暂停他的操作，直到他可以重新分配员工或叫人加班。去年的加班成本总共为60000个工时。

Watch what happens when these ideas are joined by words that indicate their relationship to each other. Here, time and cause and effect serve as connectors. 

看看当这些想法通过表明它们之间关系的词汇连接在一起时会发生什么。在这里，时间和因果关系作为连接词。

> *Last year* absenteeism ran about 9 percent *because* people would take days off without notification, *despite* the three-day notification requirement. *Consequently*, the foreman would shut down his operation until he could either call in or reassign someone for overtime. This pattern resulted in overtime costs amounting to 60,000 work hours. 
>
> 去年，旷工率约为9%，因为人们会在没有提前通知的情况下请假，尽管有三天的提前通知要求。因此，工头会暂停他的操作，直到他可以叫人加班或重新分配员工。这种情况导致了总共60000个工时的加班成本。

Even though the original paragraph contains the essential information, the rewrite is easier to read because the transitional terms signal the relationships between the facts and guide the reader along. 

尽管原始段落包含了基本信息，但改写后更易阅读，因为过渡词表明了事实之间的关系，引导读者顺利阅读。

Sometimes paragraphs will be purely explanatory. Then you may need words such as “because,” “in addition,” “further,” and “finally.” When a paragraph shows causal relations, you may begin with a word such as “when,” followed by information connected with “as a result,” “consequently,” or “finally.” 

有时段落将纯粹是解释性的。然后，你可能需要用到“因为”，“另外”，“进一步”和“最后”等词汇。当一个段落显示因果关系时，你可以以诸如“当……时”之类的词语开始，然后是与“结果是”、“因此”或“最终”相关联的信息。

Omitting transitions is never disastrous to meaning, but including them usually makes a passage more fluid and facilitates reading. Further, you may occasionally write a one-sentence paragraph that serves as a transition between key points in a document of length. 

省略过渡词对于意义来说从未是灾难性的，但通常包含它们会使文章更加流畅，便于阅读。此外，您可能会偶尔写一个只有一句话的段落，用作在一篇长文档中的关键要点之间的过渡。

Transition words can help you control your writing and assist the flow from idea to idea. First, assess the relationships between your ideas. Is it cause and effect? A phrase such as “as a result” clearly signals that something has resulted from some other action. If the document explains the causes or effects of some event, see that you signal your intentions by using such clear indicators as “because,” “grows out of,” or “results in.” Time sequences, similarly, should be logical: Words such as “initially,” “second,” “then,” “subsequently,” and “finally” serve to indicate chronological sequence. When these and other terms—such as “in conclusion” and “thus”—are used, make sure they signal the relations they stand for and not some vague connection you only half convey. In other words, see that each paragraph is tightly coherent in the way it connects details. 

过渡词可以帮助您控制您的写作，并在思想之间提供流畅的过渡。首先，评估你的思想之间的关系。是因果关系吗？诸如“因此”之类的短语清楚地表示某事是由其他行动引起的。如果文件解释了某个事件的原因或影响，确保您使用明确的指示器，如“因为”，“源于”或“导致”，来表明您的意图。类似地，时间序列应该是逻辑的：诸如“最初”，“第二”，“然后”，“随后”和“最后”的词语用于指示时间顺序。当使用这些和其他术语时，如“总之”和“因此”，请确保它们表示它们所代表的关系，而不是您仅传达一半的模糊联系。换句话说，确保每个段落在连接细节的方式上紧密一致。

## Types of Paragraphs 段落类型

Paragraphs play many roles. Their purpose is to fully explain and support a controlling idea. Often they employ different techniques to get the job done. In total, a series of paragraphs comprise a document or sections of documents. Here are some examples of various types of paragraphs. Note that some longer documents can be totally descriptive, totally chronological, or totally comparative; others may require a combination of information delivery methods. Consider a clinical trial protocol: It will have elements of description, such as the study design, the patient volunteer profile, and facilities. It will also have sections identifying procedures, the “how to” of the activities that are to occur. This type of writing is chronological. The following examples show different methods for delivering information effectively.

段落具有多种作用。它们的目的是充分解释和支持一个控制性的观点。通常它们使用不同的技巧来完成这项工作。总的来说，一系列的段落构成了一个文件或文件的部分。以下是各种类型的段落示例。请注意，一些较长的文件可以完全是描述性的、完全是按时间顺序的，或者完全是比较性的；其他可能需要结合多种信息传递方法。考虑一个临床试验方案：它将具有描述元素，如研究设计、病人志愿者概况和设施。它还将包含识别程序的部分，即活动的“如何”部分。这种类型的写作是按时间顺序的。以下示例展示了不同的有效信息传递方法。

### Descriptive Paragraphs 描述性段落

Descriptive paragraphs create an image of an event, a person, a concept, or a thing. Paragraphs that describe facilities are descriptive. So are those that present conditions, such as what a product in development should be like, or offer narrative information about patients or animals in a toxicology study. The following paragraph gives an overview of standard operating procedures. 

描述性段落为事件、人物、概念或事物创建了一个形象。描述设施的段落是描述性的。描述正在开发的产品应该是什么样子，或者提供有关毒理研究中的患者或动物的叙述性信息，都属于描述性的。以下段落概述了标准操作规程。

> Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) of a proactive company form the backbone of its operations. SOPs delineate processes from vendor qualification to materials receipt and testing, to product manufacturing and packaging, to distribution to the marketplace, and finally, to tracking the product through its shelf life. SOPs must adapt as systems and processes change, and they must undergo rigorous controls to remain accurate and current. 
>
> 积极的公司的标准操作规程（SOPs）构成了其运营的支柱。 SOPs 从供应商资格认证到物料接收和测试，再到产品制造和包装，再到分销到市场，最后到跟踪产品的保质期，它们描绘了整个过程。 SOPs 必须根据系统和流程的变化进行调整，并且必须经过严格的控制以保持准确和更新。

The following paragraph is also descriptive/informative. It is part of a document that gives an overall explanation of the validation process. 

以下段落也是描述性/信息性的。它是一份解释验证流程的整体文件的一部分。

> Actual users comprise the most effective validation teams for commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software-driven systems. Teams may have a few or as many as twenty or more members. The number of team members is directly proportional to the scope of the project. If the validation is for software that the entire company will use, a representative from each area should be on the team. A member of the Information Technology (IT) group should also be a team member. And, one person should serve as the Validation Lead. 
>
> 实际用户组成了商业现成（COTS）软件驱动系统最有效的验证团队。团队成员可以有几个人，也可以多达二十人或更多。团队成员的数量与项目范围成正比。如果验证适用于整个公司将使用的软件，团队中应该有来自每个领域的代表。信息技术（IT）小组的成员也应该是团队成员。此外，应该有一个人担任验证负责人。

### Extended Definition Paragraphs 扩展定义段落

Sometimes writers need an entire paragraph or even two to define a person, thing, concept, or event. This type of paragraph is closely related to descriptive paragraphs. For example, an extended definition paragraph about a system may tell what the system is, how it works, what it does, what it looks like now, and how it works with other systems. The following paragraph defines a clinical thermometer. 

有时，作者需要一个整整的段落，甚至两个段落，来定义一个人、事物、概念或事件。这种类型的段落与描述性段落密切相关。例如，关于一个系统的扩展定义段落可能会告诉该系统是什么，它是如何工作的，它的功能是什么，现在它的外观如何，以及它如何与其他系统一起工作。以下段落定义了临床温度计。

> A clinical thermometer is a narrow, tubular, closed glass device with one bulbous end containing mercury. It works on the principle of heat expansion. When the temperature of the bulb increases, the mercury inside expands, causing a thread to rise within the hollow stem until it stops by a marked measurement. The measurement indicates the degree of warmth.
>
> 临床温度计是一个窄长、封闭的玻璃设备，其中一个球状末端包含汞。它是基于热膨胀原理工作的。当球的温度升高时，内部的汞膨胀，导致空心茎内的线升起，直到它停在一个标记的位置。这个标记表示温度的度数。

### Cause and Effect Paragraphs 因果关系段落

Cause and effect writing usually results when someone tries to figure out what has happened and why. In essence, one thing causes something else to happen, which in turn often causes another event. Consider for example, that diphtheria causes vomiting. Vomiting in turn causes dehydration. Dehydration causes death. Note that diphtheria does not cause death. 

因果关系写作通常出现在有人试图弄清楚发生了什么以及为什么的情况下。本质上，一件事情导致另一件事情发生，而这又常常导致另一个事件。例如，白喉会导致呕吐，而呕吐则会导致脱水，脱水又会导致死亡。请注意，白喉并不直接导致死亡。

Cause and effect writing is useful when there is a deviation or nonconformance and the need is to determine and record what happened. This type of writing is useful for exploring a probable outcome for an activity, or anticipating a result of a planned action. The following paragraph is an example of cause and effect writing. Note that the controlling idea is in the first sentence. 

当出现偏差或不符合要求的情况，需要确定和记录发生了什么时，因果关系写作非常有用。在探讨活动可能的结果或预期计划行动的结果时，这种写作方式也很有用。以下段落是一个因果关系写作的示例。请注意，控制性的想法在第一句话中。

> Software modification can have a ripple effect. A simple change request from operations can affect multiple functions of the system. A change to the way a report form displays data on a computer screen can affect every place in the system that uses the same form. So, a seemingly minor change can be a difficult information technology assignment in a complex system. 
>
> 软件修改可能会产生连锁反应。运营部门的一个简单变更请求可能会影响系统的多个功能。对计算机屏幕上报告表格显示方式的改变可能会影响系统中使用相同表格的每个位置。因此，一个表面上微小的变化在复杂系统中可能是一个艰巨的信息技术任务。

### Chronological Paragraphs 时间顺序段落

Chronological Paragraphs Chronological paragraphs put information into a time sequence. Chronological paragraphs appropriately tell how things happen, have happened, or will happen. Procedures, completed studies, background sections of abstracts, and protocols are examples of chronological writing. The following paragraph gives a history. 

时间顺序段落将信息按照时间顺序呈现。时间顺序段落适当地叙述事情如何发生、已经发生或将要发生。程序、已完成的研究、摘要的背景部分和协议都是时间顺序写作的示例。以下段落给出了一个历史叙述。

> As early as the 1980s, pharmaceutical manufacturers started using automated batch record systems. While offering the advantages of paper reduction and increased efficiency, these systems brought new issues. The paper-based cGMP regulations did not address electronic record keeping. So, in 1991, a group of pharmaceutical manufacturers met with FDA to determine how to use paperless record systems and remain compliant with cGMP requirements. This effort led to an FDA task force to look at electronic records in all areas — GMP, GLP, and GCP. The result was the publication of 21 CFR Part 11 Electronic Records; Electronic Signatures Final Rule in the Federal Register. The rule became effective on August 20, 1997. 
>
> 早在20世纪80年代，制药生产商就开始使用自动化批记录系统。虽然带来了纸张减少和效率提高的优势，但这些系统也带来了新的问题。基于纸张的cGMP法规并没有涉及电子记录保存。因此，在1991年，一组制药生产商与FDA会面，确定如何使用无纸记录系统并与cGMP要求保持合规。这一努力导致了FDA成立了一个特别小组，审查了电子记录在GMP、GLP和GCP等各个领域的应用。结果是在联邦公报中发布了21 CFR Part 11电子记录；电子签名最终规定。该规定于1997年8月20日生效。

### Comparison and Contrast Paragraphs 比较和对比段落

Comparison and contrast looks at two or more things, concepts, events, or people for similarities and differences. If a company wants to purchase new equipment, such as a capping machine, a report that compares and contrasts possible equipment may be the fulcrum for a decision. Such a document might compare capacity, size, compatibility with existing equipment, price, service, and ease of validation for each piece of equipment under consideration. 

比较和对比会分析两个或更多的事物、概念、事件或人之间的相似之处和差异之处。如果一家公司想要购买新设备，比如封口机，一份比较和对比可能会成为决策的关键。这样的文件可能会比较和对比可能设备的产能、大小、与现有设备的兼容性、价格、服务以及验证的便利性。

Comparison and contrast typically occurs in identifying test and control articles in studies and results from study to study. It is also essential for evaluating vendors and suppliers. Here is an example of comparison and contrast in two paragraphs. Note that the transition word in the second paragraph is simply “also” and the comparative word is “but.” 

比较和对比通常在研究中识别测试和对照物品以及从一项研究到另一项研究的结果中发生。它也对于评估供应商和供应商至关重要。以下是两个段落的比较和对比示例。请注意，第二个段落中的过渡词只是“也”而且比较词是“但”。

> Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), a nucleic acid, forms from a repetition of simple building blocks called nucleotides. Nucleotides consist of a phosphate (PO 4 ), sugar (deoxyribose), and a base that is either adenine (A), thymine (T), guanine (G), or cytosine (C). In a DNA molecule, this basic unit repeats in a double helix structure made from two chains of nucleotides which link between the bases. The links are either between A and T or between G and C. The structure of the bases doesn’t allow other kinds of links. The double helix structure resembles a twisted ladder. 
>
> 脱氧核糖核酸（DNA），是一种核酸，由称为核苷酸的简单构建块的重复形成。核苷酸由磷酸（PO4）、糖（脱氧核糖）和一个碱基组成，碱基可以是腺嘌呤（A）、胸腺嘧啶（T）、鸟嘌呤（G）或胞嘧啶（C）。在DNA分子中，这个基本单元在两条核苷酸链中重复形成双螺旋结构，链之间通过碱基之间的连接连接。连接要么在A和T之间，要么在G和C之间。碱基的结构不允许其他类型的连接。双螺旋结构类似于扭曲的梯子。
>
> Ribonucleic acid (RNA) is *also* a nucleic acid, *but* it has a single chain and the sugar is ribose rather than deoxyribose. The bases are the same as those of DNA, except that the thymine (T) which appears in DNA is replaced by another base called uracil (U), which links only to adenine (A). 
>
> 核糖核酸（RNA）也是一种核酸，但它只有单链，糖是核糖而不是脱氧核糖。碱基与DNA相同，只是DNA中的胸腺嘧啶（T）被另一种称为尿嘧啶（U）的碱基所取代，它只与腺嘌呤（A）相连。

## Writing Headings 编写标题

Headings are important, whether they are for a journal article, an abstract, or presentation for dissemination of information to the professional community at large or for documents directed to select readers. In disclosure writing, headings serve to attract readers’ attention and impel them to read an article, abstract, poster, or other publication. In documents of length, headings assist in guiding readers through the text. They serve to separate elements and identify at a glance those sections of a document that may be of interest to specific readers. 

标题在各种文档中都很重要，无论是期刊文章、摘要，还是用于向专业社区广泛传播的演示文稿，或者用于针对特定读者的文件。在揭示性写作中，标题用于吸引读者的注意力，促使他们阅读文章、摘要、海报或其他出版物。在长篇文档中，标题有助于引导读者浏览文本。它们用于分隔元素，并在一瞥之间识别出可能对特定读者感兴趣的文档部分。

Good headings give information. If, for instance, the heading is for an abstract or professional meeting poster, it’s often the first, and sometimes only, thing people read. When writing such a headline, it’s even more important to make every word count — and to present the main idea succinctly. Consider the following heading

好的标题提供信息。例如，如果标题是为了摘要或专业会议海报，它通常是人们阅读的第一件事，有时甚至是唯一的事情。在编写这样的标题时，更重要的是要让每个词都有意义，并简洁地呈现主要观点。考虑以下标题：:

> CleanBlood™ Pathogen Inactivation of Red Blood Cells
>
> CleanBlood™ 红细胞的病原体灭活

What about pathogen inactivation? A headline that makes a point grabs the reader’s interest and can induce her to read the rest of the abstract. 

那么病原体灭活是什么？一个能够点出观点的标题能够吸引读者的兴趣，并可能诱使她阅读摘要的其余部分。

> CleanBlood™ Inactivates Protozoa, Viruses, and Bacteria in Red Blood Cells
>
> CleanBlood™ 在红细胞中灭活原生动物、病毒和细菌

The second example is a complete sentence, and it’s packed with information about the CleanBlood product. 

第二个示例是一个完整的句子，并且充满了关于CleanBlood产品的信息。

Writing informative headings is important in documents as well. A good document, whether a long memo or a more inclusive report, benefits from headings where every word tells. To call a section “Supporting Data” is insufficient. That phrase could apply to every report generated! Just as a newspaper wouldn’t entitle a feature article “News Story,” a report shouldn’t label a vital section “New Information” or “Significant Data.” Headings work best when they encapsulate what’s in the text that follows. “Development of Method 2204” is more precise, for instance, than “Method Development Two” in a report that talks about the development of several laboratory methods. 

在文档中编写信息性标题也很重要。好的文档，无论是长篇备忘录还是更全面的报告，都受益于标题，其中每个词都有意义。将一个章节称为“支持数据”是不足够的。这个短语可能适用于每个生成的报告！就像报纸不会给一个特写文章取名为“新闻报道”，一个报告也不应该将一个重要的部分标记为“新信息”或“重要数据”。当标题概括了随后文本的内容时，标题效果最佳。例如，在描述多个实验室方法开发的报告中，“方法2204的开发”比“方法开发二”更为准确。

The same caveat applies to headings for tables. The following table heading is vague and uninformative. 

相同的注意事项也适用于表格的标题。以下的表格标题含糊不清，缺乏信息。

> Summary of the Results of Toxicity Studies Conducted with Experimental Drug S-252X
>
> 对实验性药物S-252X进行的毒性研究结果摘要

A rewrite gives more information. Further, a table is a summary, so identifying it as such is redundant. Getting rid of words that don’t do their duty and replacing them with content delivers stronger information. 

重新编写可以提供更多信息。此外，表格是一个摘要，所以将其标识为摘要是多余的。消除不起作用的词语，用内容替换它们，可以提供更强的信息。

> Results of In Vitro and In Vivo Toxicity Studies of S-252X in Sprague Dawley Rats 
>
> S-252X在SD大鼠体外和体内毒性研究结果

### Make Headings Parallel in Structure 使标题结构平行

Headings don’t have to be complete sentences (although they can be), but they should be parallel in structure. That means elements within the headings themselves should be in the same form, and the headings in the entire document should parallel each other. The following report section heading lacks parallel structure. 

标题不必是完整的句子（尽管它们可以是），但它们应该在结构上是平行的。这意味着标题内部的元素应该采用相同的形式，整个文档中的标题也应该相互平行。下面的报告章节标题缺乏平行结构。

> Using Salt Ice Mixtures and the Employment of Dry Ice for Cooling
>
> 使用盐冰混合物和使用干冰进行冷却

The word “using,” a verb acting as a noun, and “employment,” a noun, are awkward together in that they are different word forms. Selecting one form brings the heading elements together, and, as often happens, eliminates extra words: 

“使用”是一个动词，充当名词，而“使用干冰”是一个名词，它们在形式上不协调。选择一个形式可以将标题元素结合起来，并且通常会消除多余的单词：

> Using Salt Ice Mixtures and Dry Ice for Cooling
>
> 使用盐冰混合物和干冰进行冷却

Similarly, a report should not have several headings that conflict in structure with others contained in the report. These headings, gleaned from a report on plant maintenance, reveal inconsistencies in parallelism.

同样地，一个报告不应该有几个标题，在结构上与报告中的其他标题冲突。以下这些标题摘自一份有关设备维护的报告，显示了平行性的不一致。

> Estimates of Electric Heating Costs Rate Determination
>
> 电加热费用估计费率确定
>
> The System Will Require Semiannual Assessment
>
> 系统将需要半年度评估
>
> Cost Data Have Been Checked by the Supplier
>
> 成本数据已由供应商核实
>
> Projection of New Fiscal Year Cost
>
> 新财年成本预测
>
> Allowing for Rate Adjustments, Estimates of Five-Year
>
> 考虑费率调整，五年费用估计
>
> Expenditure
>
> 开支

These headings work better when nouns, not verbs, control them. Further, some headings are sentences; others are phrases. Making these headings consistent assists in making the report readable. 

将这些标题的控制元素改为名词，而不是动词，效果更好。此外，一些标题是句子，而另一些是短语。使这些标题保持一致有助于提高报告的可读性。

> Electric Heating Costs Estimation
>
> 电加热费用估计
>
> Rate Determination
>
> 费率确定
>
> Semiannual Assessment Requirements
>
> 半年度评估要求
>
> Supplier’s Cost Data Evaluation
>
> 供应商成本数据评估
>
> New Fiscal Year Cost Projection
>
> 新财年费用预测
>
> Five-Year Expenditure Estimation
>
> 五年支出估计 

### Organize Headings by Rank 按等级组织标题

Short documents may require few headings; longer reports may have myriad sections and subsections. Headings for either should follow a pattern that allows delivery of a primary point first, with subsequent support relegated to subheadings. Often, main headings are centered on the page, and subheadings aligned left, but companies use a creative range of positioning. Whether you bold face, capitalize, or change the font size depends on the facilities you have available and the standards within your workplace. Generally, however, for sections of equal weight, use the same heading type size and face. Don’t give equal standing to a major section and a subpart of that section.

短文档可能只需要很少的标题，而长报告可能会有许多部分和子部分。无论是哪种情况，标题都应该遵循一种模式，允许首先传达主要观点，而随后的支持则归属于子标题。通常，主要标题居中于页面上，而子标题则左对齐，但是公司采用各种创造性的位置排列方式。无论您是使用粗体、大写，还是改变字体大小，都取决于您所拥有的工具和工作场所内的标准。然而，通常情况下，对于相同权重的部分，使用相同的标题字体大小和字体样式。不要给予主要部分和该主要部分的子部分相同的地位。

## Tables and Visuals 表格和图表

A picture is “worth a thousand words.” This axiom is particularly true in documents dealing with technical or complex data. Consider a report explaining a fire drill procedure. Wouldn’t a map assist in defining the designated routes? Or, think about directions for installing a piece of batching equipment. Wouldn’t a diagram help “show” how to do it? If you were compiling dissolution data, wouldn’t a chart or table be more comprehensive than just words? To illustrate clinical research results, for instance, a table generally works best. Trying to put complex information into words is tricky business; further, doing so can present problems for readers who must make sense of data which is often complex.

有句谚语说：“一图胜千言。”这个格言在处理技术或复杂数据的文件中尤其正确。想象一下，解释火警演练程序的报告。一张地图是否有助于确定指定的逃生路线？或者，考虑一下安装一台配料设备的说明。一张图是否有助于“展示”如何操作？如果您正在整理溶解数据，一张图表是否比仅仅使用文字更全面？例如，为了说明临床研究结果，通常最好使用表格。尝试将复杂信息用文字表达是非常困难的，而且这样做可能会给读者带来解读复杂数据的问题。

Tables are particularly useful to condense or summarize large bodies of data. When data are complex or detailed, tables are almost always the best vehicle for presentation. Tables allow readers to compare individual values and groups of data. Moreover, tables accelerate the comprehension process of readers. 

表格特别适用于压缩或总结大量数据。当数据复杂或详细时，表格几乎总是最佳的展示工具。表格使读者能够比较单个值和数据组。此外，表格加速了读者的理解过程。

The style and format of visual information will vary from company to company, but most have these elements

视觉信息的样式和格式因公司而异，但大多数都具备以下要素：

- A table or figure number  表格或图表编号

- A table or figure title  表格或图表标题

- A legend, which often resides beneath the table or visual 图例，通常位于表格或图表下方

When tables or other visuals deliver information, it’s preferable not to reiterate in text what the visuals say. Write a simple statement in the text that calls the readers’ attention to the visual. “Table 2 shows the results of the rat forced swim test.” Then, present the table. 

当表格或其他视觉元素传达信息时，最好不要在文本中重复视觉元素中的内容。在文本中简单陈述，引起读者对视觉元素的注意。例如：“表2显示了大鼠强迫游泳测试的结果。”然后，再呈现表格。

    <b><center>Principles of Table Construction 制作表格的原则</center></b>
    <P>To communicate quickly and accurately, tables require readers to 1) identify how the information is organized, 2) find the information of interest, and 3) interpret the information once it is found. Experience, convention, and some research studies have identified at least five principles that should guide the construction of tables. 
    </P>
    <p>
        为了快速而准确地传达信息，表格需要读者完成以下任务：1）识别信息的组织方式，2）找到感兴趣的信息，3）在找到信息后解释这些信息。经验、惯例和一些研究已经确定了至少五个应该指导制作表格的原则。
    </p>
    <p>
        1.Tables should have a purpose; they should contribute to and be integrated with the rest of the text.
    </p>
    <p>
        表格应该有一个目的；它们应该为文本的其余部分做出贡献并与之融合。
    </p>
    <p>
        Data should not be reported for their own sake. Rather, they should be part of a larger effort to answer the four questions of research: “What did you do?” “Why did you do it?” “What did you find?” and “What does it mean?” Thus, tables should be used only when they can communicate information more efficiently or effectively than can be done in text or figures. 
    </p>
    <p>
        不应仅仅为了报告数据而报告数据。相反，它们应该是回答研究的四个问题：“你做了什么？”“为什么这么做？”“你发现了什么？”和“这意味着什么？”的更大努力的一部分。因此，只有在表格可以比文本或图表更有效地传达信息时，才应该使用它们。
    </p>
    <p>
       2.The purpose of the table should determine its form. 
    </p>
    <p>
        表格的目的应该决定其形式。
    </p>
    <p>
        A table created to collect data is not necessarily the same table that should be used to communicate these data. A table created to organize a large amount of data so that a value can be referenced easily will not necessarily be the same as a table constructed to emphasize patterns in the data or comparisons among the patterns. 
    </p>
    <p>
        一个用于收集数据的表格未必就是用于传达这些数据的同一个表格。一个用于组织大量数据，以便可以轻松查找值的表格未必与一个用于强调数据中的模式或模式之间的比较的表格相同。
    </p>
    <p>
        Tables may be structured for analytical or reference functions. Analytical tables are designed “from the inside out” by organizing the data field to help reveal patterns in the data. Reference tables are designed “from the outside in” by organizing the column and row heads to help readers find specific information quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
        表格可以为分析或参考功能而设计。分析性表格是从内部向外部组织数据字段，以帮助揭示数据中的模式。参考表格是从外部向内部组织列和行标题，以帮助读者快速找到特定信息。
    </p>
    <p>
        3.Tables should be organized and formatted to assist readers in finding, seeing, understanding, and remembering the information. 
    </p>
    <p>
        表格应该组织和格式化，以帮助读者找到、看到、理解和记住信息。
    </p>
    <p>
        A table that contains all the necessary data but forces readers to organize the data before understanding it does everyone a disservice: it increases the time needed for readers to evaluate the data and does not assure that the author’s understanding of the data will match the readers’ interpretation of it. 
    </p>
    <p>
        一个包含所有必要数据但迫使读者在理解之前组织数据的表格对每个人都是一种不利的服务：它增加了读者评估数据所需的时间，并且不能确保作者对数据的理解将与读者的解释相匹配。
    </p>
    <p>
        4.Values to be compared should be placed side-by-side. 
    </p>
    <p>
        应将要比较的值并列放置。
    </p>
    <p>
        English is read from left to right and from top to bottom. Thus, at least in English language publications, placing values side-by-side is not only the easiest way to compare them, but it also encourages this comparison. In biomedical research, where a treatment group is compared to a control group, values for each group should be given in adjacent columns so that the variables in each row can be compared more easily. 
    </p>
    <p>
        英语从左到右，从上到下阅读。因此，至少在英语语言的出版物中，将值并列放置不仅是最容易比较它们的方式，而且还鼓励这种比较。在生物医学研究中，治疗组与对照组进行比较时，应该将每组的值放在相邻的列中，以便更容易地比较每行中的变量。
    </p>
    <p>
        5.Organize the table visually as well as functionally. 
    </p>
    <p>
        在视觉和功能上都要组织表格。
    </p>
    <p>
        Graphic elements, including spacing, should be used to help organize the table visually. Elements such as lines, bold type, outlined cells, spacing, and shading, can help readers make within- and between-group comparisons, differentiate more important values from less important ones, highlight patterns in the data, indicate special circumstances associated with the data, and so on. </p>
    <p>
        图形元素，包括间距，应该用于帮助在视觉上组织表格。诸如线条、粗体字、轮廓单元格、间距和阴影等元素可以帮助读者进行内部和组间比较，区分重要值和不重要值，突出数据中的模式，指示与数据相关的特殊情况等。
    </p>
    <p>
  Most publishers specify their format for tables, and some may not allow the full use of design elements as recommended here. 
    </p>
    <p>
        大多数出版商会规定表格的格式，有些可能不允许完全按照这里推荐的设计元素来使用。
    </p>
    <p>
        6.Data presented in tables should not be duplicated in the text. 
    </p>
    <p>
        在文本中不应重复呈现表格中的数据。
    </p>
    <p>
        Describing in the text data that are also presented in a table remains a common problem, even though most style guides and journals advise against the practice. Duplicate information takes valuable space and so is to be avoided in print publications. Values, groups, or comparisons in tables can be mentioned in the text, of course, but the table should present the data. 
    </p>
    <p>
        尽管大多数风格指南和期刊都不建议这样做，但在文本中描述也出现在表格中的数据仍然是一个常见的问题。重复的信息占用了宝贵的空间，因此在印刷出版物中应避免使用。当然，表格中的值、组或比较可以在文本中提及，但表格应该呈现数据。
    </p>
    <p>
       Tables should also be kept as simple as possible. Include only the information that is relevant to the purpose of the table.  
    </p>
    <p>
        表格也应该保持尽可能简单。只包含与表格目的相关的信息。
    </p>

Tables don’t have to be reserved for complex data. They often present simple information precisely and directly. The following table is effective in a quality assurance SOP that calls for the inspection of packaging inserts. Inspectors can tell at a glance what to look for. They can then enter the results of the inspection accordingly on an inspection form. 

| Inspection |                   Specification                   | Method | Classification |
| :------------: | :-----------------------------------------------: | :----: | :------------: |
|  Product Code  | Clear, complete, and identical to printer’s proof | Visual |       0        |
|  Batch Number  |                Clear and complete                 | Visual |       0        |
|   Label Copy   | Clear, complete, and identical to printer’s proof | Visual |       0        |

The following table provides complex information that would be difficult to present verbally and equally difficult to understand were it in another format. Notice how the text of the report directs the reader to the table.

>We calculated the percent deviation of five replicate injections of the standard solution, and one injection of additional weighing of standard from the true value, as determined from the linear regression line. Table III shows the results.

Illustrations, pie charts, bar graphs, scatter diagrams, and the like all work well in relaying information. Visuals often accomplish what words can’t. They show patterns of data and trends and allow readers to draw comparisons more readily. They can also condense data more efficiently than text can. The following visual, from a feasibility report, visually presents a process that the text identifies. 

The new system will allow us to track the dispersion of mineral oil droplets in an aqueous system with sufficient precision and sensitivity to allow the development of real-time, closed-loop control of droplet dimensions based on manipulation of the mixing rate.

    <b>Principles of Figure Construction</b>
    <p>
        1.Figures should have a purpose; they should contribute to and be integrated with the rest of the text. 
    </p>
    <p>
        As is the case with tables, data should not be reported in figures just for the sake of displaying them. Figures should be used only when they can communicate information more efficiently or effectively than can be done in text or tables. 
    </p>
    <p>
        2.The figure should be designed to assist readers in finding, seeing, understanding, and remembering the information. 
    </p>
        <p>
        When designing a figure, its purpose should be emphasized. Is the purpose to show the variability or the stability of data? To emphasize similarities or differences between groups? To show trends over time? To show linear or nonlinear relationships? 
    </p>
    <p>
        3. Figures should contain only those elements that are necessary to fulfill their purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
        Conciseness is a value in figures, as well as in scientific writing in general. Make sure that all the lines, symbols, numbers, and words in the figure are necessary and sufficient to allow readers to interpret it. In particular, avoid three-dimensional figures unless the data are actually three-dimensional.
    </p>
    <p>
        4.The data should be emphasized over other elements in the figure. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The advantage of figures is that they focus attention immediately on visual patterns of data. Thus, anything that distracts from this focus reduces the utility of the figure. For example, data points and lines should be larger or heavier than other graphic elements, such as the scales, the borders of the data field, or reference lines.
    </p>
    <p>
        5.Figures should be consistent with the principles of Gestalt perceptual psychology. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Abstracting and interpreting data from a figure is a process of visual perception. Visual perception, in turn, is influenced by several principles identified by Gestalt perceptual psychology. Following these principles when designing figures should improve the utility of the figures.
    </p>
    <li>
         <b>Primacy:</b> <i>the larger arrangement (“the Gestalt”) is seen before its components.</i> 
    </li>
    <p>
        The overall visual impression of the figure should be consistent with the actual meaning of the data. This principle can be used to manipulate readers’ perceptions: the four most common examples are the “suppressed zero,” the “elastic scale,” the “superfluous dimension,” and the “double-scale” problem (see below).
    </p>
    <li><b>Proximity:</b> <i>objects near each other tend to be seen as a group. </i></li>
    <p>
        The characters string, ••• •••, is seen as two groups, whereas •• •• •• is seen as three. Thus, put data to be compared close to each other, and separate data that are not to be compared. This principle is especially important for placing labels with respect to the data they identify.
    </p>
    <li><b>Similarity:</b> <i>similar objects tend to be seen as a group.</i></li>
    <p>
         The characters string || — — is seen as two groups, rather than as four lines. Thus, display data from the same group in an obviously and uniquely consistent way, and display data from different groups in obviously and uniquely divergent ways. This principle is essential when graphing three or more variables on the same graph. Plotting marks and data lines from the same group should look alike. They should also differ enough between groups that the groups are not confused with one another. 
    </p>
    <li><b>Continuation:</b> <i>data arranged in an obvious pattern tend to be seen as a group.</i> </li>
    <p>
        The character string, – – – – – –, is seen as a single group, whereas – – – _ _ _ is seen as two. So, when possible, indicate data from the same group by providing an obvious pattern, and disrupt any patterns that are coincidentally comprised of dissimilar data. 
    </p>
    <li><b> Closure: </b><i>a break in a pattern is automatically “filled in” to complete the pattern.</i></li>
    <p>
        For example, in the sequence, _– – _, readers usually imagine the missing symbol that would complete either the pyramid: _ – ⎯ – _ , or repeat the sequence: _– _ – _. So, emphasize any breaks that represent actual discontinuity in a pattern, and make the pattern clear when the data actually form a pattern (so readers do not have to “fill in” to complete the pattern). 
    </p>
    <p>
        6.Data presented in figures should not be duplicated in the text. As is the case with tables, do not describe in the text data that are also presented in a figure. Rather, identify in the text the important aspects of the figure to help readers interpret the data. 
    </p>

## References, Works Cited, Works Consulted

Good writing credits sources. To use someone else’s words without credit is plagiarism. Even when you paraphrase someone else’s information, that is rephrase in your own words, you need to give credit where credit is due. When you are writing for a journal, the guidelines for authors will tell you how to include references. Many companies use a software program like Endnotes, or simply employ the Endnotes feature built into Word. Some companies have style guides that show how to handle references. If that’s the case where you work, simply adhere to the style guide. Within many companies, however, such guidance is often lacking. 

If no such guidance exists where you work, it’s best to consult a style reference book. The American National Standard for Bibliographic References (ANSI) provides guidelines for referencing information. Other style guides do so as well.
