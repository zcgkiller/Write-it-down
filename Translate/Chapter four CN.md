# 4 Correspondence

When you consider the momentous effort that goes into creating a validation report or a standard operating procedure (SOP) on a complicated task, composing letters and memos may seem like child’s play by comparison. But it’s not. A letter may well be the first contact a party has with a company, and that first impression is important. Even a New Drug Application (NDA) submission relies on a cover letter to set the stage for review. Good letters are vital tools of doing business; so are memos. The primary difference between memos and letters is that letters generally have an external audience, whereas memos receive internal distribution. 

Facsimile (fax) and e-mail (electronic mail) messages are also common. A fax is an electronically transmitted message that serves the same purpose as a letter or memo. E-mail can travel to parties internal or external to a company. Technology has made transmission of information instantaneous, and with that ability come new avenues for going awry. 

All letters and memos or their electronic counterparts benefit from scrutiny. Indeed, companies are taking notice of the impressions they present. Consider a job applicant wearing a navy blue suit dotted with lint to a crucial interview. The unspoken message is lack of attention to detail and lack of pride in presentation. The visual image people project affects the responses they get. So it is with written messages: They convey, in a very accurate way, the degree of professionalism behind them. Every piece of correspondence should reflect the thought and effort that went into producing it. 

When you’re totally confident in your ability to say what you want lucidly and succinctly, you must also consider how your message looks on paper. Is it pleasing to the eye? Does the white space facilitate reading? Is the format consistent? These are all valid questions — ones that people often don’t consider when they write for the world of work. It’s all too easy to fall into careless and irregular patterns of delivery that detract from otherwise effective messages. 

>The word “format” derives from the Latin word formatus, which means “formed.” The phrase liber formatus originally described a book formed in a certain shape and size. Publishing still uses the word “format” in reference to shape, size, and layout. Webster’s Dictionary, however, offers this definition: “A general plan or arrangement of something.”

## Conventions of Letter Writing

Depending on your position, you may write many letters or few. If you work with contract manufacturers, suppliers, outside researchers, or regulatory bodies, you may generate letters frequently. If your company has an established standard, by all means adhere to it. If, however, the company has no “set” format, it’s up to you to give your letters the performance edge. Over the years, certain conventions have been accepted as the professional standards for letter writing. 

Note that the companies in the United States (US) use 8½ *×* 11 inch paper. In Europe and elsewhere A4 paper is the standard. The difference is that A4 paper is somewhat narrower and longer, at 8.27 *×* 11.69 inches. 

### Return Address and Dateline

Company stationery carries a letterhead, which usually includes the name or logo of the company, the address, phone number, a fax number, and often other information. When such a letterhead exists, include a dateline two or more lines below the letterhead. Where it’s positioned depends on the length of the message and the balance of white space. A good rule of thumb, however, is to limit the space between the letterhead and dateline to no more than six, but not less than two, lines. 

​	XYZ Company

​	23 West Ellen Avenue

​	Coldwell, Nebraska 10923

​	January 16, 2005

If you’re using stationery that has no letterhead, you should include your address and the date, but *not* your name, like this:

​	123 Main Street

​	Anytown, NJ 07000

​	March 5, 2005

### Inside Address

Depending again on the letter’s length, place the inside address two to six spaces below the dateline, aligned left. The inside address should show the courtesy title, addressee’s name, position title, and address.

Dr. Yelena Kovalerchik

Director of Research and Development

Bien Sur Pharmaceutical Co.

600 Bergen Avenue

East Hanover, New Jersey 07936

### Courtesy Titles

You can include the courtesy title even when the address includes a position title. The traditional courtesy titles are Mr., Mrs., Miss, and more recently Ms. Miss is used rarely, if at all. Even though some women object to the title Ms., just as many feel that Mrs. or Miss violates their privacy because each designates their marital status. Further, if you’re unsure of the recipient’s marital status, you risk offending her by using an inappropriate title. Thus, it’s probably best to use Ms. for women, unless you know a specific woman’s preference. 

When addressing people holding advanced degrees or appointed titles, make sure you indicate their status correctly. People often get into trouble because they address the audience inappropriately. The two most troublesome titles are *Dr.* and *Esquire.* When more than one acceptable form of address exists, use only *one,* never both. 

*Dr.,* of course, can indicate medical doctor, or M.D.; doctor of dentistry, or D.D.S.; Doctor of Veterinary Medicine, D.V.M.; Doctor of Philosophy, or Ph.D.; Doctor of Education, or Ed.D.; or Doctor of Jurisprudence, or J.D. The title *Dr.* is professionally appropriate and preferable for all; however, it is permissible to use the following forms. 

Hester Harte, 			M.D. Georges Cheval, D.V.M.
Lawrence Pullit, D.D.S. 	Victoria Norton, Ed.D.
Jane Degnan, Ph.D.

Note that for some of the above, the periods are often omitted: MD, DVM, DDS.
When you address an attorney, the preferable form is Mr. Charles Chaser, Attorney at Law. Sometimes, however, an attorney may be addressed this way:

Charles Chaser, Esq. 	or Charles Chaser, Esquire.

The term esquire has traditionally not been used to address women attorneys, but that convention is now considered sexist.
Attorney at Law is always appropriate.

### Addresses

The company name should always conform to the official name of the company you’re writing to. That means if the name includes *Incorporated,* spelled out, you should follow suit. Similarly, if the name of the company abbreviates *Incorporated,* your address should also do so. And, if *The* is a part of the official registered company name, you should include it. There’s no rule for abbreviating words that stand for street direction, so it’s acceptable to write both “West Mandrake Avenue” and “W. Mandrake Avenue.” 

When you have numbered addresses, you can treat them in several ways. Again, the key is consistency. If you write “One Federal Plaza” on your envelope, you should not write “1 Federal Plaza” in the inside address. 

>A letter is like a conversation between writer and reader in which the writer does all the talking.

Always spell out city names; never abbreviate them unless the official name of the city is abbreviated, as in St. Paul. States and territories may be abbreviated, however. The following abbreviations are the ones the United States Postal Service recommends. Using these conventions helps eliminate the confusion caused by abbreviating both Massachusetts and Maine as MA, for instance. It also eases sorting. Florida, for example, can be spelled out or abbreviated: Fla., Flor., and FL; and there are probably other creative abbreviations as well. It’s best to adhere to the established postal standards in all cases. Here are the acceptable abbreviations for US states and territories. 

| Alabama, AL              | Kentucky, KY       | Ohio, OH           |
| ------------------------ | ------------------ | ------------------ |

| Kansas, KS               | North Dakota, ND   | Wyoming, WY        |

### ZIP Codes

Write zip codes out fully. The US Postal Service recommends the hyphenated nine-digit code, which looks like this:

07701-1234

### Salutations

The salutation appears on the second line below the letter’s inside address. The standard is to begin the salutation with
*Dear* followed by the title and the last name only and a colon. If the letter is less formal and addressed to someone you know personally, begin with *Dear* followed by the person’s first name and a comma.

Dear Mr. Jones:
Dear Chuck,

No satisfactory guidelines exist for addressing several people within an organization. Women rightfully dislike being addressed as *Gentlemen,* and *Ladies and Gentlemen* offers an inappropriate connotation. *Dear Sir or Madam* is dated and somewhat pompous; in addition, many women object to being addressed as *Madam.* Finally, *To Whom It May Concern* is vague, impersonal, and frankly old-fashioned. 

It’s common to eliminate the salutation in such cases. An attention or reference line can take the place of the salutation. 

### Attention Lines

You have the option of using an attention line when you are writing to a company and want a particular person whose name you don’t know to receive your letter, or when you have a mixed audience. The attention line appears below the inside address and can replace the salutation.

Krumkage Company
1946 Central Circle
St. Edwardson, Minnesota 01062
Attention: Production Manager
or
Attention: Members of the Corporate Management Committee

### Subject and Reference Lines

These letter parts are specialized, and you may use them when you feel your reader needs to know immediately the purpose of your correspondence. These components are gaining popularity in professional letter writing, for they facilitate quick comprehension of a message. But, to be effective, they must be succinct and encapsulate the purpose of the document. The subject or reference line should appear either beneath the salutation, beneath an attention line, or by itself in place of a salutation. Allow two lines between the subject or reference line and the preceding element.

### Letter Bodies

Start your letter two lines below the salutation or subject/reference line. It used to be that longer letters were single-spaced, with double-spacing between paragraphs, and that shorter letters were double-spaced, with triple spacing between paragraphs. However, double-spacing has steadily been losing popularity and is rarely seen. The standard now is to single-space. Be sure to balance the text of the letter on the page. Word processors permit insertion of white space easily, so letters can be single-spaced and balanced on the page after the fact. Most word processing programs offer a “view document” or “print preview” option that permits the writer to see how the letter lies on the page. By all means use it. It’s handy. 

### Complimentary Closings

The closing you choose should coincide with the degree of formality reflected in the salutation and with the tone of the correspondence. It should also reflect your relationship with the addressee. Place your closing two lines below the text of the letter and punctuate it with commas. The following closings are standard and reflect, from first to last, a decreasing order of formality. Currently, *Sincerely* and *Sincerely Yours* are the most popular. 

Respectfully,
Yours truly,
Sincerely yours,
Cordially yours,
Sincerely,
Cordially,
Best wishes,
Best regards,
Warmest regards,
Regards,

### Signatures

The most common signature format includes the writer’s full name and title on the fourth and fifth lines below the complimentary closing. The two are usually aligned with the closing. Of course, the signature goes in between.

Sincerely yours,

Juliette Boone
Associate Director, Environmental Issues

When a signature indicates legal responsibility for the message on behalf of the company, the following format is standard. It includes the company’s name in capital letters two lines below the closing and the author’s typed name and title four lines below that.

Sincerely yours,
RONWAY PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY

Erin Andreas
Vice President, Regulatory Affairs

It used to be that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required black ink for signatures. This reflected the ability of copying machines to reproduce black ink legibly but not blue or other colors, and the use of black ink for any signatures on any documents became the norm. These days, few professionals pay inordinate attention to the color of the ink they sign their names with, and in the grand scheme of things it’s probably not all that important. Recent studies, however, have shown that people respond best to blue ink: It seems to indicate a personal touch and a degree of sincerity. Also, it’s always nice to know a real person took time to personally sign a letter when the signature could as easily have been reproduced. 

Finally, it’s not customary to include *Dr., Mr.,* or *Mrs.* below your signature. When you sign your letters, use your given and surname only. 

Respectfully yours,

Michelle Miller
Director of Training and Development

### Enclosure Notations

When you include other documents with your letter, an enclosure notation is appropriate. Include the notation one or two lines below the closing. The enclosure notation should indicate the number of accompanying documents and may indicate what they are specifically. Use a period, a colon, a dash, or no punctuation at all.

Enclosures 3
Enclosures: 2
Enc. 2
Enc: 2 checks, 1 statement
Enclosures—2 checks, 1 statement

### Distribution Notations

When you plan to distribute copies of your correspondence to persons other than the addressee, indicate your intent by including the letters *cc:* or simply *c:* . *CC* indicates “carbon copy,” and most copies are no longer carbons; *c:* indicates “copy,” and is becoming the standard. Also acceptable is *pc:,* for “photocopy,” or simply *copy* or *copies* spelled out. 

Copies: Charla Bannett
	      Diane Wanat
	      Mary Ehret

​	cc: Members of the Management Committee

Occasionally, you may wish to give a copy of a letter to a second or third party, but not indicate that recipient on the primary letter. When that’s the case, you can write *bc:,* which indicates “blind copy,” or *bcc:* which indicates “blind carbon copy.” Then on your file copy you can include the secondary recipient’s name. 

bc: Hengshe He
bcc: Martin Weinstein

### Word Processor’s Initials

> It’s a rare writer who can produce an effective piece of correspondence in the first draft. Precision usually comes with revision.

The individual who operates a word processor may include his or her initials after the closing to indicate that someone other than the author had a hand in preparing the letter. The word processor’s initials, in lower-case letters, usually follow the author’s initials, which are in capital letters. A colon, slash, or asterisk are common punctuation marks. Occasionally the author’s name is spelled out. However, more and more frequently, the author’s name or initials are omitted, for they merely repeat. This entire convention will most likely soon be acceptably eliminated.

### Postscripts

Except on sales letters and letters that add a personal note, postscripts are infrequent. Postscripts should not add, as an afterthought, an idea you neglected to include in the body of your letter. If you forget to mention a key point, it’s best to rewrite.

Postscripts are very effective in sales letters, however, because they can reemphasize a *key point,* such as a particular benefit to a new client. Sales letters often include as the postscript the point that’s most likely to get the recipient to react positively. Postscripts appear at the very end of letters, after the last notation. 

### The Page Layout

Letters should be neatly prepared and balanced with uniform margins. Usually, the bottom margin is slightly larger than the top. You may opt to align your text in the right-hand margin as well as the left. Doing so, however, may mean that you will have large spaces between long words in a line. Aligning the left margin only creates a ragged right margin for your text, but readability is usually better when the spaces between words are uniform. You should also avoid breaking words at the ends of lines with hyphens, unless they are unusually long. However, don’t break two lines in a row. Visually, your message will become difficult to absorb if you do.

### Correspondence of Two or More Pages

Whereas most business correspondence can neatly sit on one page, occasionally a letter of two or more pages must go out. When that’s the case, begin the second page five lines from the top with a line identifying the addressee, the date, and the page number. The identifying line is usually flush left, but it can be centered, or flush right, depending on preference. 

Dr. Ansel P. Angstrom, June 5, 1993, page 2 

You can abbreviate the month or use numerals. Begin the text of your second page two lines below the identifying line. 

## Standard Letter Formats

Letter writers have options when formatting their correspondence. There is no official “rule” for laying information on a page, and companies often adopt stylized formats that become part of their signature look. Several formats, however, have become standard, and they are presented here.

### Semiblock

Semiblock has enjoyed status as the most traditional format for many years. The dateline and closure appear on the right-hand side of the page, approximately two to five characters right of the center of the stationery. The inside address, salutation, and end notations align left. Paragraphs indent five spaces, or more. Some companies actually use up to fifteen spaces. Semiblock allows for some interesting and dramatic stylized correspondence.

#### Product Alert Letter

The following letter, a field alert, adheres to the conventions for semiblock.

#### Complaint Response Letter

The next letter, a response to a complaint, adheres to the conventions for modified block.

        Dear Valued Customer:
    </p>
    <p>
        It has come to our attention that Rubella IgM Test Kit bearing Lot Number XYZ may, under certain circumstances, mask positive results. It is extremely unlikely that you will experience a problem with your testing, however. </p>
    <p>
        Internal testing has demonstrated a tendency for the antigen coated onto the microwells to denature and lose reactivity when washed with a solution prepared with reagent-grade water that has a pH of 4.5 or less. Most laboratory water systems deliver reagent grade water with a pH well in excess of 4.5. 
    </p>
    <p>
        We recommend that you determine the pH of the water used in your laboratory. In the event that your system demonstrates a lowered pH, you may add 0.1M sodium hydroxide to your reagent-grade water in a quantity sufficient to raise the pH to a minimum level of 5.0 prior to diluting the wash solution.
    </p> 
    <p>
        If your laboratory has been using this lot of reagent in conjunction with low pH water, please be assured that this is not a safety issue. Denaturization of the antigen would be flagged by low reactivity of the Positive Control and therefore yield unreportable results. 
    </p>
    <p>
       We apologize for any inconvenience and concern caused by this situation. If you have additional questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact your Technical Services Representative.  
    </p>
    <p>
    Thank you for your attention to this matter. We look forward to our continued partnership.
