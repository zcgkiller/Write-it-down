# 2 Connecting Writer and Reader
People who assess it overwhelmingly point to one problem in writing: a lack of understanding of and perception about the audience. Knowing whom your documents address and what response you want is a key to successful technical writing. This kind of writing informs people of past activities, findings, and decisions; it presents data and makes recommendations; it provides records of ongoing projects; it tells people how and why to take certain actions; it tells what kind of outcome is likely from intended actions; and it always has an audience — sometimes immediate and well known, other times projected. Often documents directed to a future audience go to immediate readers who need the information for interim work processes.

>When you write to FDA, the entire industry is a potential audience.
>						——Monica Grimaldi,
>					Certified Quality Engineer

You can create grammatically correct and efficient passages that offer the information you need to convey. But overlooking the effects of your words on your readers is all too easy. That’s why, when you write, you need to step back and evaluate the readers. Who are they? How will they respond to the information you’re giving? Most people run the risk of not being objective about their readers, because when they write they are much more involved with what they have to say than they are with how readers will receive it.

This holds particularly true in the technical disciplines, where an initial reader may have knowledge of a project equal to that of the writer, but the intended audience may not be privy to the underlying details of a project. Other documents, such as technical notes, have no direct or immediate audience, and the intent is to supply a record of a problem resolved or record an issue. Nevertheless, while you may not know *now* who will seek a future record, you can assume someone will, so you will need to include enough background information to make the message understandable to the possible future reader.

The laboratory notebook is a good example of writing that’s done for an immediate audience: those persons coordinating projects and overseeing routine activities who are in positions to make decisions. Should the data in the notebook lead to significant discovery, then the data in the notebook become the foundation for development. So future audiences may include anyone who seeks a record of a project, including a regulatory body such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Thus, information must be clear, complete, and comprehensible to all pertinent, possible readers, not just the immediate ones.

>The palest ink is better than the best memory.
>							——Chinese proverb

Similarly, you may write a report to inform a scientific area of the company of a project’s progress, but a projected audience may well be a regulatory body who will look at the report at some point in the future. Thus, it’s smart to include information that the projected audience may require for complete understanding — but which is, nevertheless, not crucial for your immediate audience. Consider the case of a Quality Assurance (QA) Director who served as the project lead in the validation of a renovated plant facility. He included far more background and information than he had to for the simple reason that the facility would eventually be subject to a compliance inspection. He deemed it best to capture the complete history of the renovated facility, because he did not want to be in the position of having to recreate it at a future point.

A dossier that goes to a regulatory agency for review and product approval usually includes a large number of supporting documents, such as those prepared as the development progressed often over a period of ten years or more. When information is summarized, such as within individual portions of a New Drug Application (NDA) or Common Technical Document (CTD), writers really won’t know who the precise readers will be for the sections or their supporting documents. There may be many readers who will read various sections of a submission. For instance, a reviewer at FDA for a Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls (CMC) section of a submission will most probably not be the same reviewer as the one who looks at clinical data. And neither reviewer will have seen the supporting study documents when they were actually written. Those will have had a more immediate audience at the time the actual study reached completion. The common link here is usually the project manager at the agency who has been working with the company’s regulatory people and providing insight and suggestions for compiling the submission. And that dialog should set the tone for the writing.

Questions to ask before putting pen to paper — or booting up the computer — are the following:

- Who are the immediate readers?

- Who may read this document in the future?

- How much do the immediate readers already know about the topic?

- What do future readers need to know to understand the topic?

- What response do you want? 

Consider this passage from a Chemical Hygiene Plan. It is incomplete and vague. What is missing that the readers need to know? How can it be more explicit and direct?

> Where there is no immediate danger to the skin from contact with a hazardous chemical, it is still prudent to select clothing to minimize exposed skin surfaces. A laboratory coat should be worn over street clothes and be laundered regularly. A laboratory coat is intended to prevent contact with direct, chemical dusts, and minor chemical splashes of spills. If it becomes contaminated, it should be removed immediately and affected skin surface washed thoroughly. Employees should wear long legged clothing and avoid short trousers or skirts to cover areas that lab coats do not. Shoes should be worn in the laboratory at all times. Sandals and perforated shoes are not permitted in the laboratory. In addition long hair should be confined.

The above passage falls short because it does not directly address the readers and does not follow through in its directive. Further, the passage does not include related information the readers need. Who launders the lab coats? In the following rewrite, there is no question. The rewrite also gets rid of the conditional (“should be”), speaks directly to the reader, and tells how to follow through.

>Where there is no immediate danger to the skin from contact with a hazardous chemical, it is still prudent to select clothing to minimize the risk of exposure. Wear clothing with long legs to cover areas that lab coats do not. Avoid short pants or skirts to minimize exposure risk. Wear socks and closed shoes at all times; do not wear sandals and perforated shoes. In addition, confine long hair for your safety and to prevent compromising the integrity of the lab work. In addition, do not wear jewelry that can catch in laboratory equipment. Most important, always wear a laboratory coat over street clothes. Laboratory coats prevent contact with dirt, chemical dusts, and minor chemical splashes or spills. Always wear clean laboratory coats and dispatch soiled ones to the hamper bins in the change room.<br>Note: If you suspect your lab coat has become contaminated, remove it immediately, bag it, and wash all exposed skin surfaces thoroughly. Refer to the MSDS sheet for any additional measures. Call the Chemical Hygiene Officer to collect the contaminated lab coat.

## Readers’ Language Skills

Whether you are writing for internal distribution or external, you must consider the language skills of your readers. When writing to a regulatory body, you can be confident that readers will have a degree of sophistication to enable them to understand fairly complex data. These people have read similar documentation repeatedly. 

If you prepare a manuscript, you can also be confident that if you write according to the style set forth by the publication, the readers will readily comprehend what you say. These readers are your colleagues and will have comparable language skill sets. The same holds true for posters and slide sets. The audience that reviews posters in an exhibit hall does so because of interest in what others in the industry are doing; they attend presentations for the same reason. 

Not all readers possess the same skills. Some documents must be comprehensible to a much lower reading level, and it is critical that they be. Work instructions for a manufacturing environment are best in clear, direct language that speaks to a tenth grade or lower reading level. Informed consent for potential participants in clinical trials is also best written to an eighth grade or lower reading level as well, as is patient literature. 

<div class="warning" style='padding:1.5em; background-color:#eef0f4; color:#69337A'>
    <center><b>Informed Consent</b></center>
    <p>
        <b>What Is Informed Consent?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        Informed consent is not a signature on a piece of paper. It is a process undertaken to assure that people are fully informed about the choices available for their health care. Informed consent is based on the legal and ethical rights of individuals to direct their own care and the ethical duty of physicians to involve their patients in their own care. Individuals have the right to refuse information about procedures or surgeries, but they must initiate the request, not be offered it. After it is determined that the person understands the proposed intervention and has reached a decision, his/her signature on the informed consent form denotes acceptance of the proposed intervention.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>When Is Informed Consent Needed?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        Informed consents are required for invasive interventions (for example, procedures, anesthesia, and surgeries); before being given certain medications (for example, flu shots) or receiving certain tests (for example, HIV testing); and before participating in research projects. What needs to be included in an informed consent? Informed consent needs to include:
    </p>
    <p>
        <li>The rationale for the intervention</li>
        <li>The nature of the proposed intervention</li>
        <li>Reasonable and medically appropriate alternatives to the proposed intervention</li>
        <li>The risks and benefits of the proposed and all alternative interventions</li>
        <li>The anticipated outcome of the proposed intervention.</li>
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Who Can Give Informed Consent?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        Conscious, competent individuals can give informed consent. An incompetent or incapacitated individual needs a surrogate decision maker to give informed consent. Parents give informed consent for their dependent children. In most states, emancipated minors can give informed consent. Most states also allow minors to seek treatment for sexually transmitted diseases, pregnancy, and drug or alcohol abuse on their own.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Tips for Writing Informed Consent</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      When writing informed consent forms, be sensitive to a person's ability to digest complicated or bad news, and be sensitive to personal (cultural or religious) beliefs of the regional population.
    </p>
    <p>
        Rely on the following when writing informed consent forms:
    </p>
    <p>
        <li>Provide alternative language (Spanish, for example) informed consent forms for individuals whose first language is not English.</li>
        <li>Explain the proposed intervention in consumer friendly language, not technical jargon.</li>
        <li>Define all terms and write out phonetic pronunciation of all unfamiliar terms.</li>
        <li>List risks in as nonthreatening a way as possible.</li>
        <li>Put risks in perspective. For example, about 1 in 50,000 healthy people die from general anesthesia; you have about double that chance to die in an automobile accident.</li>
    </p>

</div>

Another consideration is whether readers are native born speakers and writers of English, or if they are foreign born. In most pharmaceutical, device, and biologic environments, the mixture of employees is multinational. The same is true of patient populations for clinical trials. The result is that, although your readers may have sufficient language skills to comprehend most communication related to activities with which they are familiar, they may not understand a term you consider critical, or they may have difficulty decoding a complex passage. If you suspect that’s a possibility, it’s easy to give a quick explanation or include a brief glossary if the document is long, or to rewrite to simplify presentation. Remember that it’s a rare reader who will confess to “not understanding” if he thinks his lack of comprehension stems from his own inabilities. Provide the meanings you intend your readers to have so that there will be no misunderstanding.

Further, if you are a writer for whom English is a second language, you may be bringing certain conceptions about writing, unfounded in standard American conventions, to your workplace. In some cultures for instance, when a writer sums up information for a reader, it is tantamount to saying, “You probably won’t understand the data, so I’ll have to explain it.” Such a message can seem insulting. In written English, however, the standard is to explain the significance of data. Always tell your readers what you mean and what the significances of certain facts are. Never leave the message open to interpretation.

<div class="warning" style='padding:1.5em; background-color:#eef0f4; color:#69337A'>
    <center>The average person has three vocabularies:</center>
    <li>Reading is the largest.</li>
    <li>Speaking is the next largest.</li>
    <li>Writing is the smallest.</li>
    <p>
        In writing, words must carry 90 percent of our messages. Punctuation and graphics convey the rest.
    </p>

## Writing Directly to the Reader

Many documents work best when they speak directly to the readers. When you seek an immediate response from specific readers, the best way to make sure the response is what you want is to involve them. You may write directly to fellow employees where you work; you may also write directly to readers external to the company. Sometimes you will write to one person specifically; just as often, your immediate readers may be two or more.

Many pieces of writing address readers directly. Letters, memos, and emails certainly do. So does informed consent for clinical trials. Other documents that speak directly to readers, such as methods, instructions, procedures, and operator manuals, usually work best in the imperative voice, which simply means the “you” in the writing is understood. The imperative voice uses the present tense and is the only instance in English where you can compose a complete sentence without actually writing out the subject. For example, “Write it down” is a directive, and the “you” is understood to be the reader. Understood as well is that the audience for these documents has been trained in the processes. Typical steps in a procedure, such as these that tell how to measure flow rate, have an implied “you”:

6.1 Make sure the clamp securing the funnel to the vibrator is properly affixed.
6.2 Open the air valve and adjust the regulator to 16 psi.

### A Preventive Maintenance Memo

Consider this internal memo about preventive maintenance to a project engineer. Here the author writes directly to the engineer but does not include him in the communication at all.

    <p><b>JORSTAD LABORATORIES</b>			Internal Memorandum</p>
    <P><b>DATE:</b>August 16, 2005</P>
    <p><b>TO:</b>Matthew Zarelli</p>
    <p><b>FROM:</b>John Lopez</b></p>
    <p><b>RE:</b>Preventive Maintenance</p>
    <p>At the weekly meeting on August 14, 2005, it was decided to review aspects of the preventive maintenance program to assess its sufficiency. The preventive maintenance for sophisticated components of the fluid bed dryer has been contracted out to Glatt and Co. The in-house work orders for the past month have all been reviewed, and none are related to preventive maintenance.</P>
    <p>During the weekly staff meeting, the question of possible “downtime” in production because of simple maintenance needs was not discussed. A meeting should be arranged that includes the maintenance manager. Regular preventive maintenance must be addressed.</P>
    </div>
While the paragraphs in this memo are grammatically reasonable and present key information, they’re not doing the best job they can. The writer has focused on the information that precipitated the memo. Seriously lacking is what the writer expects from the recipient. How does the information relate to the reader? What role has the reader played in the development of events? And who should arrange the meeting that will address preventive maintenance? Will the reader be involved in making the decision about preventive maintenance?

A rewrite that addresses the engineer directly, using “we,” “our,” “you,” and “your” produces a much clearer message that’s more likely to get results. In the first version, the writer refers to himself once, but not at all to the reader. In the second version, the writer includes the reader ten times and directs the engineer to action. The rewritten memo is more effective because the reader knows what action he must take, and he knows it up front.

    <p><b>FROM:</b>John Lopez</b></p>
    <p><b>RE:</b>Preventive Maintenance</p>
    <p>Please arrange a meeting and include the maintenance manager so that we can discuss preventive maintenance and devise a plan for action. As we discussed at our weekly meeting on August 16, 2005, we are going to review the work orders for your area to see if aspects of the current regular preventive maintenance program are sufficient.</P>
    <p>As you pointed out then, the preventive maintenance for “sophisticated components of the fluid bed dryer” was contracted out to Glatt and Co., and thus that equipment is regularly serviced. However, maintenance of equipment not under contract remains an issue. Since our meeting, I have reviewed all the work orders for the past month, and you are right: Preventive maintenance has not been a priority. In addition, during the weekly staff meetings, we did not discuss whether any equipment has suffered “downtime” because of maintenance needs. I firmly agree that we must address these issues, and our meeting will be the place to start.</P>

### Announcing an Inspection

>When we give serious consideration to who will read what we’ve written, what they already know, and what they need to know, we are much more likely to hit the mark.
>
>——**Arlene Johnson,**
>——**Author**

The following memo effectively addresses several key people who need the information contained therein to prepare for an FDA inspection. Notice how the memo tells people directly what they need to do in preparation for the FDA visit. Further, while it refers recipients to the established protocol, it reiterates what the writer feels is essential. In addition, it refers to the recipients 15 times, with the words “you” and “your” and “we” and “our,” as well as with the use of the imperative voice of “you” under stood. This technique clearly makes the readers part of the message. This memo is effective.

## Focusing on the Information

Writing directly to readers, when you know who they are and want a specific response, is usually the most effective way to deliver information. However, much of the time, your purpose in writing will be to present information that’s part of a larger picture. Such documents as analytical reports, summary reports, and project analyses frequently make little or no mention of the reader, nor do they need to, because their purpose is to provide a history or other information.

Documents that don’t call for reader action directly must still present what readers need to know to understand what has happened, what is happening, or what will be happening, as well as the conclusions and recommendations resulting from specific findings. Often, documents are but links in a chain of documents, and getting the overall picture of a project may require understanding of much more than what the document at hand presents.

Even if immediate reviewers and approvers comprehend what’s in a report, filling in the gaps can be useful, even if it means repeating some information the initial readers already know. In the same vein, controlling your delivery so that it is clear and direct also makes sense. Using internal jargon, for instance, in a report that may be subject to future outside scrutiny is foolish, for doing so invites questions that demand answers. How much better to be lucid and complete in the first place!

It’s better to err on the side of giving more information than your immediate audience needs than to be sparse in data or detail, which you may be asked to produce at some future point. There’s a fine line, here, however. Your written histories should provide the information relevant to certain activities; they should not trigger unrelated questions that arise from the inclusion of inappropriate details. Worse is to make statements that are unsupported; blanket statements without support are sure triggers for queries from readers, and when readers start to question, you may ultimately wind up giving more information than you intend or need to. Good writing gives readers what they need to know. Thus, a writer may deliver the same information in several versions depending on the readers’ need to know and level of technical comprehension. 

### Summarizing an Investigation

Many documents focus purely on events. Investigations, for example, tend to be directed toward activities leading up to a conclusion. Readers play no role other than that of understanding the information and perhaps responding to it routinely. For instance, a manufacturing deviation report will present the findings of an investigation; the result of those findings may provide the basis for deciding whether to rework or discard a batch.

The following technical note does not call for reader action directly because the purpose is to provide a history of an occurrence. Addressed to the Director of Quality Control, the memo summarizes the result of an investigation.

        February 15 retesting of 098C3-Q1234RT-18M and 098C3-Q1235RT-18M failed to confirm the test results obtained from the dissolution tests performed on January 29 and 30, 200- The February 15 testing showed a higher potency than the earlier testing did. An investigation revealed that the low potency was a result of the vials being previously opened, and consequently the samples had absorbed moisture and increased in weight. Thus, while the weights in the tests were identical, the ratio of active ingredient to total weight was not, since the first test samples had proportionately higher water content, and therefore proportionately smaller active ingredient.

        Retesting using a new standard from an unopened vial verified a potency of 947.67 mcg/mg and a standard factor of 0.0671 mcg/ml. Assays LIC-99-0039 and LIC-99- 0040 substantiate these results.
