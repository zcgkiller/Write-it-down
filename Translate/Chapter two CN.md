# 2 Connecting Writer and Reader 连结作者与读者
People who assess it overwhelmingly point to one problem in writing: a lack of understanding of and perception about the audience. Knowing whom your documents address and what response you want is a key to successful technical writing. This kind of writing informs people of past activities, findings, and decisions; it presents data and makes recommendations; it provides records of ongoing projects; it tells people how and why to take certain actions; it tells what kind of outcome is likely from intended actions; and it always has an audience — sometimes immediate and well known, other times projected. Often documents directed to a future audience go to immediate readers who need the information for interim work processes.

评估写作时，人们普遍指出一个问题：缺乏对受众的理解和感知。了解你的文档面向的是谁，以及你希望得到什么样的反应，是成功技术写作的关键。这种写作方式告知人们过去的活动、发现和决策；它提供数据并提出建议；它记录正在进行的项目；它告诉人们如何以及为什么采取某些行动；它告诉人们预期的行动可能会产生什么样的结果；而且它总是有受众的——有时是直接和熟知的，有时是预期的。通常，针对未来受众的文档会送到需要这些信息进行中期工作过程的立即读者手中。

You can create grammatically correct and efficient passages that offer the information you need to convey. But overlooking the effects of your words on your readers is all too easy. That’s why, when you write, you need to step back and evaluate the readers. Who are they? How will they respond to the information you’re giving? Most people run the risk of not being objective about their readers, because when they write they are much more involved with what they have to say than they are with how readers will receive it.

你可以创建语法正确且高效的段落，以提供你需要传达的信息。但忽视你的文字对读者的影响是非常容易的。这就是为什么当你写作时，你需要退后一步，评估读者。他们是谁？他们会如何对你提供的信息作出反应？大多数人会存在主观性，因为在写作时，他们更关注自己要表达的内容，而不是读者将如何接收它。

This holds particularly true in the technical disciplines, where an initial reader may have knowledge of a project equal to that of the writer, but the intended audience may not be privy to the underlying details of a project. Other documents, such as technical notes, have no direct or immediate audience, and the intent is to supply a record of a problem resolved or record an issue. Nevertheless, while you may not know *now* who will seek a future record, you can assume someone will, so you will need to include enough background information to make the message understandable to the possible future reader.

这一点在技术领域尤其适用，其中初始读者可能对项目的了解与作者相当，但预期的受众可能不了解项目的基本细节。其他文档，如技术笔记，可能没有直接或即时的受众，其目的是提供已解决的问题或记录一个问题的记录。然而，虽然你现在可能不知道未来谁会寻求这份记录，但你可以假设会有人这样做，因此你需要包含足够的背景信息，使信息对可能的未来读者能够理解。

The laboratory notebook is a good example of writing that’s done for an immediate audience: those persons coordinating projects and overseeing routine activities who are in positions to make decisions. Should the data in the notebook lead to significant discovery, then the data in the notebook become the foundation for development. So future audiences may include anyone who seeks a record of a project, including a regulatory body such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Thus, information must be clear, complete, and comprehensible to all pertinent, possible readers, not just the immediate ones.

实验室笔记本是一个很好的例子，它是为了即时的受众而写的：那些协调项目和监督日常活动、有权做出决定的人。如果笔记本中的数据导致重大发现，那么这些数据将成为开发的基础。因此，未来的受众可能包括寻求项目记录的任何人，包括食品药品监督管理局（FDA）等监管机构。因此，信息必须对所有相关可能的读者清晰、完整、易懂，而不仅仅是即时的受众。

Similarly, you may write a report to inform a scientific area of the company of a project’s progress, but a projected audience may well be a regulatory body who will look at the report at some point in the future. Thus, it’s smart to include information that the projected audience may require for complete understanding — but which is, nevertheless, not crucial for your immediate audience. Consider the case of a Quality Assurance (QA) Director who served as the project lead in the validation of a renovated plant facility. He included far more background and information than he had to for the simple reason that the facility would eventually be subject to a compliance inspection. He deemed it best to capture the complete history of the renovated facility, because he did not want to be in the position of having to recreate it at a future point.

同样，你可能会写一份报告，向公司的某个科学领域通报项目的进展，但预期的受众可能是未来某个时间点会审阅报告的监管机构。因此，聪明的做法是包含一些预期受众可能需要的信息，以便完全理解——而这些信息对于你的直接受众来说并非至关重要。考虑一个质量保证（QA）主管的案例，他担任了翻新工厂设施验证项目的负责人。他获得了比必要信息更多的背景和细节，这是因为该设施最终将接受合规检查。他认为最好记录下翻新设施的完整历史，因为他不希望在未来的某个时候不得不重新创建这些信息。

A dossier that goes to a regulatory agency for review and product approval usually includes a large number of supporting documents, such as those prepared as the development progressed often over a period of ten years or more. When information is summarized, such as within individual portions of a New Drug Application (NDA) or Common Technical Document (CTD), writers really won’t know who the precise readers will be for the sections or their supporting documents. There may be many readers who will read various sections of a submission. For instance, a reviewer at FDA for a Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls (CMC) section of a submission will most probably not be the same reviewer as the one who looks at clinical data. And neither reviewer will have seen the supporting study documents when they were actually written. Those will have had a more immediate audience at the time the actual study reached completion. The common link here is usually the project manager at the agency who has been working with the company’s regulatory people and providing insight and suggestions for compiling the submission. And that dialog should set the tone for the writing.

提交给监管机构进行审查和产品批准的档案通常包含大量的支持文件，这些文件在开发过程中通常会在十年或更长时间内逐步准备。当信息被总结时，比如在新药申请（NDA）或共同技术文件（CTD）的各个部分中，作者真的不知道具体读者将会是哪些人或者他们的支持文件是谁。可能会有很多读者阅读提交的各个部分。例如，FDA的审查员在审查提交的制造与控制部分时，很可能不会是审查临床数据的审查员。而且，当实际编写支持研究文件时，两位审查员都不会看到这些文件。这些文件在实际研究完成时可能有更直接的读者。这里的共同联系通常是监管机构的项目经理，他一直与公司的监管人员合作，并为编制提交文件提供见解和建议。这个对话应该为写作设置基调。

Questions to ask before putting pen to paper — or booting up the computer — are the following

在动笔或打开计算机之前，需要考虑以下几个问题：

- Who are the immediate readers?立即的读者是谁？

- Who may read this document in the future?未来可能会阅读这份文件的人是谁？

- How much do the immediate readers already know about the topic?立即的读者对这个主题了解多少？

- What do future readers need to know to understand the topic?未来的读者需要了解什么来理解这个主题？

- What response do you want? 你希望得到什么样的反应？

Consider this passage from a Chemical Hygiene Plan. It is incomplete and vague. What is missing that the readers need to know? How can it be more explicit and direct?

考虑化学卫生计划中的这段话。 它是不完整且模糊的。 读者需要了解什么？ 怎样才能更明确、更直接呢？

> Where there is no immediate danger to the skin from contact with a hazardous chemical, it is still prudent to select clothing to minimize exposed skin surfaces. A laboratory coat should be worn over street clothes and be laundered regularly. A laboratory coat is intended to prevent contact with direct, chemical dusts, and minor chemical splashes of spills. If it becomes contaminated, it should be removed immediately and affected skin surface washed thoroughly. Employees should wear long legged clothing and avoid short trousers or skirts to cover areas that lab coats do not. Shoes should be worn in the laboratory at all times. Sandals and perforated shoes are not permitted in the laboratory. In addition long hair should be confined.
>
> 即使没有与有害化学品接触时的直接危险，选择衣物以最大程度地减少暴露的皮肤面积仍是明智的。应该穿戴实验室大衣覆盖在平时的服装上，并且定期清洗。实验室大衣的用途是防止直接接触化学粉尘和轻微的化学飞溅或溢泼。如果实验室大衣被污染，应立即脱下并彻底清洗受影响的皮肤面。员工应该穿着长裤，并避免穿着短裤或短裙，以遮盖实验室大衣无法覆盖的部位。实验室内必须随时穿鞋，不允许穿凉鞋和有孔鞋。此外，长发应该束起来。

The above passage falls short because it does not directly address the readers and does not follow through in its directive. Further, the passage does not include related information the readers need. Who launders the lab coats? In the following rewrite, there is no question. The rewrite also gets rid of the conditional (“should be”), speaks directly to the reader, and tells how to follow through.

上面的段落存在不足，因为它没有直接与读者进行沟通，并且在指示方面没有后续。此外，该段落也没有包含读者所需的相关信息。谁洗涤实验室大衣？在以下的改写中，没有问题。改写还去掉了条件语气（“应该”），直接与读者交流，并告诉如何执行。

>Where there is no immediate danger to the skin from contact with a hazardous chemical, it is still prudent to select clothing to minimize the risk of exposure. Wear clothing with long legs to cover areas that lab coats do not. Avoid short pants or skirts to minimize exposure risk. Wear socks and closed shoes at all times; do not wear sandals and perforated shoes. In addition, confine long hair for your safety and to prevent compromising the integrity of the lab work. In addition, do not wear jewelry that can catch in laboratory equipment. Most important, always wear a laboratory coat over street clothes. Laboratory coats prevent contact with dirt, chemical dusts, and minor chemical splashes or spills. Always wear clean laboratory coats and dispatch soiled ones to the hamper bins in the change room.
>
>Note: If you suspect your lab coat has become contaminated, remove it immediately, bag it, and wash all exposed skin surfaces thoroughly. Refer to the MSDS sheet for any additional measures. Call the Chemical Hygiene Officer to collect the contaminated lab coat.
>
>在与危险化学品接触时，如果皮肤没有直接受到危害，仍然应选择衣服以最小化暴露风险。穿长裤以覆盖实验大衣无法保护的部位。避免穿短裤或裙子以降低暴露风险。始终穿袜子和闭合鞋子，不要穿凉鞋或有孔的鞋子。此外，为了您的安全和防止影响实验工作的完整性，请束缚长发。此外，不要佩戴可能卡在实验设备中的珠宝。最重要的是，始终穿实验室大衣覆盖街服。实验室大衣可以防止接触污垢、化学尘埃和轻微的化学飞溅或泼溅。始终穿着干净的实验室大衣，并将脏的大衣放入更衣室的衣篓。
>
>注意：如果怀疑实验大衣被污染，请立即脱下并装入袋中，彻底清洗所有暴露的皮肤表面。有关其他措施，请参阅MSDS表格。请联系化学卫生官员收集被污染的实验大衣。

## Readers’ Language Skills 读者的语言能力

Whether you are writing for internal distribution or external, you must consider the language skills of your readers. When writing to a regulatory body, you can be confident that readers will have a degree of sophistication to enable them to understand fairly complex data. These people have read similar documentation repeatedly. 

无论是写给内部分发还是外部读者，都必须考虑读者的语言能力。当向监管机构撰写时，可以有信心读者具备一定的复杂数据理解能力。这些人已经反复阅读了类似的文件。

If you prepare a manuscript, you can also be confident that if you write according to the style set forth by the publication, the readers will readily comprehend what you say. These readers are your colleagues and will have comparable language skill sets. The same holds true for posters and slide sets. The audience that reviews posters in an exhibit hall does so because of interest in what others in the industry are doing; they attend presentations for the same reason. 

如果准备一份稿件，可以确信，如果按照期刊设定的风格写作，读者会轻松理解你的观点。这些读者是你的同行，他们具备相似的语言技能。海报和幻灯片集也是如此。在展览大厅审查海报的观众之所以这样做，是因为他们对行业内其他人正在做什么感兴趣；他们参加演讲的原因也是一样。

Not all readers possess the same skills. Some documents must be comprehensible to a much lower reading level, and it is critical that they be. Work instructions for a manufacturing environment are best in clear, direct language that speaks to a tenth grade or lower reading level. Informed consent for potential participants in clinical trials is also best written to an eighth grade or lower reading level as well, as is patient literature. 

并非所有读者拥有相同的技能水平。有些文件必须能够让语言水平较低的读者理解，并且这一点至关重要。制造环境下的作业指导最好使用清晰、直接的语言，适合十年级或更低水平的读者。临床试验潜在参与者的知情同意书也最好写成八年级或更低水平的语言，病人资料也是如此。

    <center><b>Informed Consent 知情同意书</b></center>
    <p>
        <b>What Is Informed Consent? 什么是知情同意书</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        Informed consent is not a signature on a piece of paper. It is a process undertaken to assure that people are fully informed about the choices available for their health care. Informed consent is based on the legal and ethical rights of individuals to direct their own care and the ethical duty of physicians to involve their patients in their own care. Individuals have the right to refuse information about procedures or surgeries, but they must initiate the request, not be offered it. After it is determined that the person understands the proposed intervention and has reached a decision, his/her signature on the informed consent form denotes acceptance of the proposed intervention.
    </p>
    <p>
        知情同意不仅仅是在一张纸上签字。它是一个过程，旨在确保人们对其健康护理的选择有充分了解。知情同意基于个人在法律和伦理上对自己的护理有自主权的权利，以及医生在伦理上将患者纳入自己护理的责任。个人有权拒绝有关程序或手术的信息，但必须主动提出请求，而不是被提供。在确定个人已经理解了拟议的干预措施并作出决定后，他/她在知情同意书上签字表示接受拟议的干预措施。
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>When Is Informed Consent Needed? 什么时候需要知情同意书</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        Informed consents are required for invasive interventions (for example, procedures, anesthesia, and surgeries); before being given certain medications (for example, flu shots) or receiving certain tests (for example, HIV testing); and before participating in research projects. What needs to be included in an informed consent? Informed consent needs to include:
    </p>
    <p>
        知情同意书在进行侵入性干预（例如手术、麻醉和治疗等）、接受某些药物（例如流感疫苗）或进行特定检测（例如HIV检测）之前是必需的，并且在参与研究项目之前也需要。知情同意书需要包括以下内容：
    </p>
    <p>
        <li>The rationale for the intervention 干预方案的理由</li>
        <li>The nature of the proposed intervention 拟议干预的性质</li>
        <li>Reasonable and medically appropriate alternatives to the proposed intervention 合理和医学上适当的替代方案</li>
        <li>The risks and benefits of the proposed and all alternative interventions 拟议干预及所有替代方案的风险和利益</li>
        <li>The anticipated outcome of the proposed intervention.拟议干预的预期结果</li>
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Who Can Give Informed Consent?谁可以做知情同意</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        Conscious, competent individuals can give informed consent. An incompetent or incapacitated individual needs a surrogate decision maker to give informed consent. Parents give informed consent for their dependent children. In most states, emancipated minors can give informed consent. Most states also allow minors to seek treatment for sexually transmitted diseases, pregnancy, and drug or alcohol abuse on their own.
    </p>
    <p>
    意识清醒、能力正常的个人可以做知情同意。无能或丧失能力的个人需要由代理决策人来做知情同意。父母可以代表他们的未成年子女做知情同意。在大多数州，解除监护权的未成年人也可以做知情同意。大多数州也允许未成年人自行就诊治疗性传播疾病、怀孕以及药物或酒精滥用问题。
</p>
    <p>
        <b>Tips for Writing Informed Consent 编写知情同意书的提示</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      When writing informed consent forms, be sensitive to a person's ability to digest complicated or bad news, and be sensitive to personal (cultural or religious) beliefs of the regional population.
    </p>
    <p>
    在编写知情同意书时，要考虑到个人理解复杂或不好的消息的能力，并对地区人口的个人（文化或宗教）信仰保持敏感。
</p>
    <p>
        Rely on the following when writing informed consent forms 编写知情同意书时，请考虑以下内容：:
    </p>
    <p>
        <li>Provide alternative language (Spanish, for example) informed consent forms for individuals whose first language is not English. 为非英语为母语的个人提供其他语言的知情同意书（例如西班牙语）</li>
        <li>Explain the proposed intervention in consumer friendly language, not technical jargon. 用易于理解的消费者友好语言解释拟议的干预措施，而不是技术术语</li>
        <li>Define all terms and write out phonetic pronunciation of all unfamiliar terms. 定义所有术语，并写出所有不熟悉术语的音标</li>
        <li>List risks in as nonthreatening a way as possible. 以最不具威胁性的方式列出风险</li>
        <li>Put risks in perspective. For example, about 1 in 50,000 healthy people die from general anesthesia; you have about double that chance to die in an automobile accident. 将风险放入适当的背景中。例如，约有5万名健康人中有1人会因全身麻醉而死亡；与此相比，您在车祸中死亡的机会大约是这个数字的两倍</li>

Another consideration is whether readers are native born speakers and writers of English, or if they are foreign born. In most pharmaceutical, device, and biologic environments, the mixture of employees is multinational. The same is true of patient populations for clinical trials. The result is that, although your readers may have sufficient language skills to comprehend most communication related to activities with which they are familiar, they may not understand a term you consider critical, or they may have difficulty decoding a complex passage. If you suspect that’s a possibility, it’s easy to give a quick explanation or include a brief glossary if the document is long, or to rewrite to simplify presentation. Remember that it’s a rare reader who will confess to “not understanding” if he thinks his lack of comprehension stems from his own inabilities. Provide the meanings you intend your readers to have so that there will be no misunderstanding.

另一个需要考虑的因素是读者是否以英语为母语，并且是否是外国出生。在大多数制药、医疗设备和生物学环境中，员工的组合是多国的。在临床试验的患者群体中也是如此。结果是，尽管您的读者可能具备足够的语言技能来理解与他们熟悉的活动相关的大部分交流，但他们可能不理解您认为关键的术语，或者可能难以解读复杂的段落。如果您怀疑可能存在这种情况，可以很容易地进行简单解释，或者如果文件很长，可以包含简要的词汇表，或者简化表达方式。请记住，很少有读者会承认“不理解”，如果他认为自己的理解困难源于自身能力。提供您打算让读者理解的含义，以确保不会产生误解。

Further, if you are a writer for whom English is a second language, you may be bringing certain conceptions about writing, unfounded in standard American conventions, to your workplace. In some cultures for instance, when a writer sums up information for a reader, it is tantamount to saying, “You probably won’t understand the data, so I’ll have to explain it.” Such a message can seem insulting. In written English, however, the standard is to explain the significance of data. Always tell your readers what you mean and what the significances of certain facts are. Never leave the message open to interpretation.

此外，如果英语是您的第二语言，您可能会将某些关于写作的概念带入工作场所，而这些概念可能与美国标准约定无关。例如，在某些文化中，当作者为读者总结信息时，等同于在说：“你可能不会理解这些数据，所以我必须解释一下。” 这样的信息可能会显得冒犯。然而，在英语写作中，标准是解释数据的意义。始终告诉您的读者您的意思以及某些事实的意义。永远不要让信息存在多种解释的可能性。

## Writing Directly to the Reader 直接面向读者写作

Many documents work best when they speak directly to the readers. When you seek an immediate response from specific readers, the best way to make sure the response is what you want is to involve them. You may write directly to fellow employees where you work; you may also write directly to readers external to the company. Sometimes you will write to one person specifically; just as often, your immediate readers may be two or more.

许多文件在直接面向读者时效果最佳。当你希望从特定读者那里获得即时回应时，最好的方法是让他们参与其中。你可以直接向你所在公司的同事们写作；也可以直接向公司外的读者写作。有时你会专门写给某个人；同样经常，你的直接读者可能是两个或更多人。

Many pieces of writing address readers directly. Letters, memos, and emails certainly do. So does informed consent for clinical trials. Other documents that speak directly to readers, such as methods, instructions, procedures, and operator manuals, usually work best in the imperative voice, which simply means the “you” in the writing is understood. The imperative voice uses the present tense and is the only instance in English where you can compose a complete sentence without actually writing out the subject. For example, “Write it down” is a directive, and the “you” is understood to be the reader. Understood as well is that the audience for these documents has been trained in the processes. Typical steps in a procedure, such as these that tell how to measure flow rate, have an implied “you”:

许多写作作品直接面向读者。比如信函、备忘录和电子邮件。同样，临床试验的知情同意书也是如此。其他直接面向读者的文档，如方法、指令、程序和操作手册，通常最好使用祈使语态，这意味着写作中的“你”是隐含的。祈使语态使用现在时态，并且是英语中唯一一个可以在不实际写出主语的情况下组成完整句子的情况。例如，“Write it down”（把它写下来）是一个指令，而“you”（你）被理解为读者。同时，这些文档的受众通常在这些过程中接受了培训。程序中的典型步骤，例如告诉如何测量流量的步骤，有一个隐含的“you”：

6.1 Make sure the clamp securing the funnel to the vibrator is properly affixed.

6.1 确保将漏斗固定在振动器上的夹子正确安装。

6.2 Open the air valve and adjust the regulator to 16 psi.

6.2 打开空气阀，并将调节器调整到16 psi。

### A Preventive Maintenance Memo 预防性维护备忘录

Consider this internal memo about preventive maintenance to a project engineer. Here the author writes directly to the engineer but does not include him in the communication at all.

请考虑以下给项目工程师的内部备忘录。在这里，作者直接向工程师写信，但却完全没有将他纳入沟通的范围内。

    <p><b>RE:</b>Preventive Maintenance预防性维护</p>
    <p>At the weekly meeting on August 14, 2005, it was decided to review aspects of the preventive maintenance program to assess its sufficiency. The preventive maintenance for sophisticated components of the fluid bed dryer has been contracted out to Glatt and Co. The in-house work orders for the past month have all been reviewed, and none are related to preventive maintenance.</P>
 <p>在2005年8月14日的每周会议上，我们决定审查预防性维护计划的各个方面，以评估其是否足够完备。复杂的流化床干燥机组件的预防性维护已经委托给了Glatt and Co.过去一个月的公司内部工作订单已经全部审核，没有一个与预防性维护相关。</P>
    <p>During the weekly staff meeting, the question of possible “downtime” in production because of simple maintenance needs was not discussed. A meeting should be arranged that includes the maintenance manager. Regular preventive maintenance must be addressed.</P>
<p>在每周的员工会议上，并未讨论可能因简单维护需求而导致生产停机的问题。我们应该安排一次会议，包括维护经理在内，来讨论定期的预防性维护计划。</P>
    </div>
While the paragraphs in this memo are grammatically reasonable and present key information, they’re not doing the best job they can. The writer has focused on the information that precipitated the memo. Seriously lacking is what the writer expects from the recipient. How does the information relate to the reader? What role has the reader played in the development of events? And who should arrange the meeting that will address preventive maintenance? Will the reader be involved in making the decision about preventive maintenance?

尽管这份备忘录中的段落在语法上是合理的，并且提供了关键信息，但它们还可以做得更好。作者把重点放在引起这份备忘录的信息上。严重不足的是作者没有表明对收件人的期望。信息与收件人有何关联？收件人在事件的发展中扮演了什么角色？谁应该安排将要讨论预防性维护的会议？收件人是否会参与做出预防性维护的决策？

A rewrite that addresses the engineer directly, using “we,” “our,” “you,” and “your” produces a much clearer message that’s more likely to get results. In the first version, the writer refers to himself once, but not at all to the reader. In the second version, the writer includes the reader ten times and directs the engineer to action. The rewritten memo is more effective because the reader knows what action he must take, and he knows it up front.

用“我们”、“我们的”、“你”和“你的”直接对工程师进行重写，可以产生更清晰的信息，这样更有可能得到结果。在第一个版本中，作者提到了自己一次，但没有提到收件人。而在第二个版本中，作者在十处提到了收件人，并指示工程师采取行动。重写后的备忘录更加有效，因为收件人知道他必须采取什么行动，并且他能在前面就了解这一点。

    <p>Please arrange a meeting and include the maintenance manager so that we can discuss preventive maintenance and devise a plan for action. As we discussed at our weekly meeting on August 16, 2005, we are going to review the work orders for your area to see if aspects of the current regular preventive maintenance program are sufficient.</P>

    请安排一次会议，并邀请维护经理参加，我们将讨论预防性维护并制定行动计划。正如我们在2005年8月16日的周例会上讨论的，我们将审核你所负责区域的工作订单，以确定当前的定期预防性维护计划是否足够。
</p>
    <p>As you pointed out then, the preventive maintenance for “sophisticated components of the fluid bed dryer” was contracted out to Glatt and Co., and thus that equipment is regularly serviced. However, maintenance of equipment not under contract remains an issue. Since our meeting, I have reviewed all the work orders for the past month, and you are right: Preventive maintenance has not been a priority. In addition, during the weekly staff meetings, we did not discuss whether any equipment has suffered “downtime” because of maintenance needs. I firmly agree that we must address these issues, and our meeting will be the place to start.</P>
<p>
    正如你当时指出的，流化床干燥器的“复杂组件”的预防性维护已经委托给了Glatt公司，因此该设备得到了定期维护。然而，未纳入合同的设备维护仍然是一个问题。自我们会议以来，我已经审查了过去一个月的所有工作订单，你说得对：预防性维护并不是我们的优先事项。此外，在每周的员工会议上，我们也没有讨论是否因维护需求而导致任何设备出现“停机”情况。我完全同意我们必须解决这些问题，并且我们的会议将是开始的地方。

### Announcing an Inspection 检查通知

The following memo effectively addresses several key people who need the information contained therein to prepare for an FDA inspection. Notice how the memo tells people directly what they need to do in preparation for the FDA visit. Further, while it refers recipients to the established protocol, it reiterates what the writer feels is essential. In addition, it refers to the recipients 15 times, with the words “you” and “your” and “we” and “our,” as well as with the use of the imperative voice of “you” under stood. This technique clearly makes the readers part of the message. This memo is effective.

以下备忘录有效地通知了几位需要其中信息来准备FDA检查的关键人员。请注意，备忘录直接告诉人们在FDA访问前需要做什么准备。此外，虽然备忘录将收件人引用到既定的协议中，但它重申了作者认为的重要内容。此外，备忘录在15处提到了收件人，使用了“你”和“你的”以及“我们”和“我们的”等词语，同时使用了“你”暗示的祈使语气。这种技巧明确地将读者融入了信息之中。这份备忘录非常有效。

### Announcing a GMP Audit GMP审计通知

The same common-sense approach works when you are writing to readers outside the company: Include them in the message. The following notice to a contractor advises of an impending current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) audit. Notice how it addresses the reader directly and calls for action.

同样的常识方法在您向公司外的读者写信时同样适用：将他们纳入到信息中。下面这封给承包商的通知是关于即将进行的当前良好生产规范（cGMP）审核。请注意它如何直接面向读者，并呼吁采取行动。

## Focusing on the Information 焦点信息的重要性

Writing directly to readers, when you know who they are and want a specific response, is usually the most effective way to deliver information. However, much of the time, your purpose in writing will be to present information that’s part of a larger picture. Such documents as analytical reports, summary reports, and project analyses frequently make little or no mention of the reader, nor do they need to, because their purpose is to provide a history or other information.

当你知道读者是谁，并且希望得到特定的回应时，直接写给读者通常是传递信息最有效的方式。然而，很多时候，你写作的目的是提供作为更大背景的信息。例如，分析报告、总结报告和项目分析经常很少或根本不提及读者，因为它们的目的是提供历史或其他信息。

Documents that don’t call for reader action directly must still present what readers need to know to understand what has happened, what is happening, or what will be happening, as well as the conclusions and recommendations resulting from specific findings. Often, documents are but links in a chain of documents, and getting the overall picture of a project may require understanding of much more than what the document at hand presents.

虽然不需要直接要求读者采取行动的文件仍然必须提供读者需要了解的信息，以理解已经发生、正在发生或将要发生的事情，以及由具体发现得出的结论和建议。通常，这些文件只是文件链中的一环，要了解整个项目的全貌可能需要理解比手头文件呈现的信息更多。

Even if immediate reviewers and approvers comprehend what’s in a report, filling in the gaps can be useful, even if it means repeating some information the initial readers already know. In the same vein, controlling your delivery so that it is clear and direct also makes sense. Using internal jargon, for instance, in a report that may be subject to future outside scrutiny is foolish, for doing so invites questions that demand answers. How much better to be lucid and complete in the first place!

即使立即审核者和批准者理解报告中的内容，填补信息的空白也是有用的，即使这意味着重复一些初始读者已经知道的信息。同样，在控制你的表达方式时，清晰和直接也是明智的选择。例如，在可能会受到未来外部审查的报告中使用内部行话是愚蠢的，因为这样做会引发需要回答的问题。多么好的做法是一开始就清晰而完整地表述！

It’s better to err on the side of giving more information than your immediate audience needs than to be sparse in data or detail, which you may be asked to produce at some future point. There’s a fine line, here, however. Your written histories should provide the information relevant to certain activities; they should not trigger unrelated questions that arise from the inclusion of inappropriate details. Worse is to make statements that are unsupported; blanket statements without support are sure triggers for queries from readers, and when readers start to question, you may ultimately wind up giving more information than you intend or need to. Good writing gives readers what they need to know. Thus, a writer may deliver the same information in several versions depending on the readers’ need to know and level of technical comprehension. 

在给予比你的立即读者需要的更多信息的一方面，要比数据或细节不足更好。因为在未来某个时候可能需要你提供这些细节。然而，在这里存在一个微妙的平衡。你的书面历史应该提供与某些活动相关的信息，但不应该引发来自包含不适当细节的问题。更糟糕的是，做出不受支持的陈述；没有支持的概括性陈述肯定会引发读者的质疑，当读者开始质疑时，你最终可能会提供比你本意或需要的更多信息。好的写作要给读者提供他们需要了解的信息。因此，作家可能会根据读者需要了解和技术理解水平在几个版本中传递相同的信息。

### Summarizing an Investigation 调查总结

Many documents focus purely on events. Investigations, for example, tend to be directed toward activities leading up to a conclusion. Readers play no role other than that of understanding the information and perhaps responding to it routinely. For instance, a manufacturing deviation report will present the findings of an investigation; the result of those findings may provide the basis for deciding whether to rework or discard a batch.

很多文档纯粹关注事件本身。例如，调查通常着重于导致结论的活动。读者在其中没有其他角色，除了理解信息，可能还需要常规回应。例如，一个制造偏差报告会呈现调查的结果；这些结果可能成为决定是否重新加工或丢弃一批产品的依据。

The following technical note does not call for reader action directly because the purpose is to provide a history of an occurrence. Addressed to the Director of Quality Control, the memo summarizes the result of an investigation. 

下面的技术说明不需要直接要求读者采取行动，因为其目的是提供一个事件的历史记录。这封备忘录是写给质量控制主管，总结了一次调查的结果。

    </P>
    <p>
        February 15 retesting of 098C3-Q1234RT-18M and 098C3-Q1235RT-18M failed to confirm the test results obtained from the dissolution tests performed on January 29 and 30, 200- The February 15 testing showed a higher potency than the earlier testing did. An investigation revealed that the low potency was a result of the vials being previously opened, and consequently the samples had absorbed moisture and increased in weight. Thus, while the weights in the tests were identical, the ratio of active ingredient to total weight was not, since the first test samples had proportionately higher water content, and therefore proportionately smaller active ingredient.
    </p>
    <p>
        在2月15日重新测试098C3-Q1234RT-18M和098C3-Q1235RT-18M的结果未能确认1月29日和30日进行的溶解试验结果。2月15日的测试显示效力高于之前的测试。经过调查发现，效力低下是由于试管之前被打开，导致样本吸收了湿气并增加了重量。因此，虽然测试中的重量相同，但有效成分与总重量的比例不同，因为第一次测试样本含有较高的水分，从而有效成分相对较小。
    </p>
    <p>
        Retesting using a new standard from an unopened vial verified a potency of 947.67 mcg/mg and a standard factor of 0.0671 mcg/ml. Assays LIC-99-0039 and LIC-99- 0040 substantiate these results.

### Summarizing a Complaint Investigation

The following memo focuses on the events and does not call for action from the reader; its purpose is to inform the recipient, a Regulatory Director, of the results of a complaint investigation. The Director, in turn, will compose a complaint response.

    	RE: 2 mg/5 mL complaint
    </p>
    <p>
        Quality Assurance has reviewed the following 0.5 mg/1 mL product complaint and found radioactivity in the excess precipatated material and low final activity in the product.
    </p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <td>Site</td>
        	<td>Lot</td>

            <td>456</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
        The isotope from Radiostuff Inc. has periodically become bound in the excess precipitate formed during the labeling of the product. The isotope caught up in the precipitate is a result of isotope colloids forming during the preparation of the isotope-product complex. The formation of isotope colloids is dependent on the lot of isotope. In addition to this product complaint, three additional complaints the same day proved to be related to the labeling of the products with isotope lot 66B2. In addition to isotope lot–related issues, there are several other interrelated variables, including the importance of strictly following the labeling procedure on the package insert. Quality Assurance completed a report on the causes of isotope colloid formation during the labeling procedure in January 2005. It is available in the QA Archives. 
    </p>
    <p>
        A review of the production records found them to be acceptable. The complaint incident does not represent a serious or unexpected drug experience, so a report of the incident to FDA is unnecessary. However, a review of isotope-related complaints from last year is now underway to determine if further clarification of this recurring situation is possible.

The thrust of the following memo is to announce a trade dress revision. It does not call for any action on the part of the readers and simply presents information about a change in market image of a product. Ultimately it will become part of a product development outline. It is direct and to the point and uses the corporate “we.”

## The Words You Choose

Much has been said about objectivity and subjectivity. Remaining objective is generally the goal for writing, unless we are preparing a piece of correspondence that contains a personal message. What does being “objective” rather than “subjective” mean? Being objective really means focusing on the best, most direct delivery of information for the reader’s understanding without interjection from the writer. Subjectivity allows the writer’s opinion to come through.

However, many people who teach and assess writing have come to understand that, while some passages can be more objective than others, no writer can rid himself of subjectivity completely. The words writers choose are the results of their thinking patterns and their personalities; so are their language constructions. Thus, the writer’s voice really reflects the individual who first composes a document. Perhaps that’s why so many eyes see most documents generated within companies developing or manufacturing therapeutic products, at contract research organizations, and at clinical sites. In an effort to be objective, rather than subjective, most technical people focus on the activity rather than the doer of the activity when recording information. However, whereas this approach is logical, it’s not law. People, after all, comprise companies. People communicate what they know to others. They present their findings and ideas so that other people can examine them, either immediately or in the future.

Readers generally receive information better if it includes a doer of the action, an active “we did this” rather than “this was done” approach. Studies show that when reading the passive voice the audience tends to turn the information around anyway before digesting it. Thus, it often makes sense to say “we” when you mean your department or area. Indeed, the corporate “we” is a handy device when you speak on behalf of a unit. You can also refer to your department or area directly: “New Product Development (NPD) has completed the formulation.” (Chapters 9, 10, and 11 give more information about the passive voice.)

Don’t shun using “I” either. Many documents that speak directly to people appropriately incorporate “I,” the writer. “I’m sending you the dissolution data you requested yesterday” is direct and to the point in a brief memo. Even in longer reports, it’s okay to include yourself. “During July, I completed the validation of the in-house method” delivers information straightforwardly in a periodic report. Howard Kanare, author of Writing the Laboratory Notebook, points out that a notebook entry that says “I saw the mixture turn blue after 10 min.,” is preferable to what scientists often write: “It was observed that the mixture changed color after a few minutes had elapsed.”

A word of caution is probably wise here, however. Many technical arenas have for so long avoided the use of the first person and first person plural in correspondence and documentation that it feels unnatural, and may even seem “unprofessional.” Exercise some judgment, but make your decision knowing that including the doer of the action violates no professional writing standards.

The following passage is an excerpt from a Drug Master File from a Pre- Market Approval Application (PMAA). Notice that it is objective and factual, yet the writer here does not choose to eliminate the corporate “we.” The result is direct and easy to read text.

> Abrams, Inc. began development of the active pharmaceutical ingredient in 2003. Development was in three phases. An initial small scale processing produced material for toxicology studies and research. In 2003 through 2004, Abrams scaled the process to provide sufficient final intermediate to allow production by an alternate manufacturing source for the final active pharmaceutical ingredient. No manufacturing occurred before 2004.

> In 2004, Abrams, under our directive, undertook a major development project to improve process safety and reduce process cycle-time and process waste. The result of this final phase development effort was the drug product which is the subject of this submission.

We provide the details of the lots produced during development and explain the changes in the processes relative to lot usage in the development studies. 

## Using Suitable Language

You must also make sure your memos, letters, and reports present your information in terminology your readers will understand. If you are a chemist writing to another chemist, you share expertise, and complex technical terms will probably pose few problems. If you are a chemist, however, writing to an information systems specialist, you may very well run into difficulties, just as you might in conveying information if you are a chemical engineer writing to a line supervisor. Again, awareness of the expertise of the recipient is tantamount to successful delivery and acceptance. 

The following excerpt from an engineering department planning a laboratory renovation was addressed to a director of analytical development.

> Enclosed herewith is the laboratory master plan proposal which abandons the one previously proposed by engineering in favor of a proposed master plan for a facility with six additional modified workstations, and one additional door to the corridor to facilitate access and egress and interfacing between the analytical laboratory undergoing restoration and quality control.

Here the writer has forgotten that the reader of his review, a chemist, is not a facility engineer and has not been a party to all the discussions that have gone into developing the original proposal. Even though the director may understand what is necessary in the laboratory, she may not be prepared to work out the difference between a “master plan proposal” and the plan “previously proposed.” She can easily become befuddled if the vocabulary impedes the message. 

The phrasing “to facilitate access and egress and interfacing between the laboratory undergoing restoration and quality control,” means, simply put, “to make going back and forth between the analytical development lab and quality control easier.” In his choice of words, the writer betrays either ignorance of the person who will be reading his analysis or carelessness in presenting the information. 

You can avoid the grief that will surely befall you if you submit writing such as this. For one thing, look for words such as “proposed” and “proposal” that each seem to be one word referring to two different things or ideas. This is called “equivocation,” and here it is confusing—not richly ambiguous as it would be in a piece of literature. Second, if it isn’t possible to reduce technical verbiage to concrete terms, supply brief definitions—a phrase or two—or examples to clarify things for the nontechnical reader. Third, on the assumption that as master plans, such documents are subject to review long after they have been put together and after their authors have moved on to other jobs, ask the reviewer to supply context or briefly repeat background information that other memos might include in more detail—that is, the circumstances of the suggestions under review. 

At times it’s appropriate to use technical terminology. Most professions have their own “shorthand”—terms that are unique to a particular subject area. Among specialists, this shorthand, or jargon, can save time and even communicate information more precisely than if it were eliminated. When you say “We’re working out the ‘bugs’ in the system,” or “The computer is down,” you’re communicating succinctly to people who are computer knowledgeable but perhaps unclearly to those who aren’t. What you must do, then, is evaluate your audience and make sure you’re using diction that will do the best job for you. When a chemist refers to “two unknowns,” another chemist will immediately understand that two impurities have not been identified. A less technical person might not. 

Evaluate what needs to be said and to whom. What can happen as a result of unnecessary jargon is that your reader will think you’re trying to put something over on him, or worse, won’t understand what’s being said at all. In addition, since most companies have their own jargon, you may run the risk of including terminology that means one thing to you, but something quite different to an external reader. 

## Controlling Acronyms

Acronyms are specialized jargon. They’re created from the first letters of a group of words, or from a combination of letters and parts of words. For example, GC is an acronym for gas chromatography; IPA is an acronym for isopropyl alcohol; and SOP is an acronym for Standard Operating Procedure. These acronyms are perfectly clear to most technical people and they probably need no explanation. 

Yet acronyms are endemic in this industry—so much so that FDA includes a list of common acronyms on its website. A very real danger of acronyms wreaking havoc can occur when a company uses an acronym to mean a thing easily understood internally, but that means something entirely else to an external auditor, joint-venture manufacturer, or FDA inspector. Even cGMP, which most of the industry understands to mean current Good Manufacturing Practices, can indicate something quite different—cyclic guanosine monophosphate. 

So unless you are sure your reader knows that DTA means differential thermal analysis, you’ll be better off spelling the words out. It never hurts to handle acronyms the way most technical writing experts advise: Simply spell out the full term in the first citation and follow it with the acronym in parenthesis. 

>We hope to complete the Modified Release Facility (MRF) by June.
>In subsequent references within the document, simply use the acronym.
>The MRF facility will be producing solid dosage products.

To prevent confusion and ensure consistency, careful writers follow these guidelines as well.

- In most cases, do not use periods within or after the acronym, except at the end of a sentence.
- Do not use an apostrophe with a plural acronym.
  - CRFs, IRBs, INDs
- When affixing a prefix to an acronym, hyphenate the prefix and the acronym.
- pre-IND submission activities

Most companies have also realized that it’s sensible to maintain a list of acronyms specific to the company. This they usually do as part of a style guide or style sheet. Such a tool makes the appropriate acronym available to writers and deflects the possibility of confusion or misunderstanding as to what company writers mean. (Chapter 14 provides a lengthy list of industry-specific acronyms.) 

## Connotation and Denotation

The English language is such that we have many, many words to indicate the same thing. These are synonyms. And while synonyms will appear in the dictionary as definitions for each other, there are often subtle variations. So the first definition is the primary meaning of a word, the denotation; what follows are usually the connotations of the word. A word like “smell” may be defined as “odor” or “scent,” but the three words have different connotations, the associations we place on them, with “odor” being most negative, “smell” somewhat less negative, and “scent” as positive and light, and aroma also positive, but stronger. You must, therefore, choose your words carefully so that the precise understanding of the message is the result. 

## Defining Terms

Once you know to avoid unnecessary jargon and unidentified acronyms that may baffle and befuddle readers, concern yourself with clarifying the rest of the words essential to the message. Remember, information is useful only if it makes sense, and what makes sense to you may not make sense to your readers. 

Readers with technical expertise similar to yours will most likely understand specialized data without lengthy explanation. But readers with less technical expertise than yours will generally have trouble absorbing the information. Therefore, evaluate the appropriateness of your words and select terms so as to make the information readily comprehensible and impossible to misinterpret. In a work environment, only the rare reader will consult a dictionary to read a letter or memo, let alone a long report. In technical writing, terms open to interpretation deserve definition. 

For instance, if an engineer writes a report on the safe installation and operation of electrical equipment that includes as its audience new technicians, he may need to include a definition of “grounding.” Similarly, an inhouse manual that describes an SOP system should include a definition of key terms as they apply to the system. For instance, “Active SOP” can be defined to include the existing version of an SOP undergoing revision. When the revised version becomes “active,” the previous version is “retired”; however, a “withdrawn” SOP can denote a document no longer in use in any version. The terms “retired” and “withdrawn” can be easily interchanged unless they are clearly defined. Consider these terms: “current document,” “obsolete document,” “inactive document,” “disabled document,” and “enabled document.” These designations are common to document control systems and will vary from company to company. Hence, they demand definition. 

There are several effective ways to define terms. These include parenthetical, restatement, classification, operation, etymology, background, and negation. Often a definition will employ more than one technique. In essence, here’s how they work. 

### Parenthetical Definition

Parenthetical definitions include an explanation in parenthesis after the word.

>We discarded the effervescent (bubbling) mixture.
>Identify the scientific (taxonomic) name of a phylum, class, order, family, or genus.

### Restatement Definition

Restatement definitions offer an appositive word or phrase that restates the term. Note that this type of definition calls for two commas when it appears within a sentence to set off the restatement, unless it comes at the beginning or end of a sentence. Sometimes a restatement definition is a separate sentence.

>A polygraph, an instrument used in lie detection, records changes in pulse, blood pressure, and respiration.
>
>The trees outside the new facility are deciduous; that is, they shed their leaves by the end of October.

### Classification Definition

Classification tells what family a word belongs to.

>A dog is a member of the canine family.
>A tumor is a neoplasm.
>Bluetongue II virus is a member of the Reoviridae family.

### Operation Definition

An operation definition tells how something works or happens.

>A disorder of the pituitary gland or pancreas causes diabetes, a metabolic disease characterized by excessive urination, persistent thirst, and often, an inability to metabolize sugar.
>
>Air-to-air solar heating circulates cool air from inside the facility, across a collector plate, which is heated by sunlight on the roof, and then back into the facility.

### Etymology Definition

Etymology looks back in time to the roots of words. Approximately two thirds of the words in the English language have their origins in Latin and Greek.

>“Biology” comes from the root “bio,” meaning “life,” and “ology,” meaning “study of.”
>
>“Chromatograph” comes from the root “chroma,” meaning “color,” and “graph,” meaning “write.”

### Background Definition

A background definition gives some history.

> Gasohol, a mixture of 90% unleaded gasoline and 10% ethyl alcohol (ethanol), has gained some acceptance as a fuel, since it is comparable in performance to 100% unleaded gasoline with the added benefit of having superior antiknock properties. 

### Negation Definition

Definition by negation means telling what something is not.

> Adsorption is not a misspelling of absorption. Adsorption causes liquid to adhere to a surface, like dew on a leaf, while absorption pulls liquid in, much like a sponge drinks up water. 

## Nondiscriminatory Language

Cautious writers take care to avoid using language that sounds discriminatory. Racism and sexism have worked their way insidiously into the American language. It’s probably impossible to rid writing of every metaphor that holds meanings for male and female or ethnic affiliation, but you can certainly act to be sure you use the language to promote social equality rather than hinder it. Choose terms and expressions that don’t refer to people in ways that can be considered negative or discriminatory. 

One way to avoid discriminatory statements is to choose qualifiers carefully. To say “a woman manager” is discriminatory. To refer to “the Hispanic technician on the six o’clock shift” is as well. And to write that “her innovative ideas belie her age,” even with the intent to compliment, is foolhardy. Unnecessarily drawing attention to differences without cause is discriminatory. 

Be careful, too, not to use “he,” “him,” or “his” exclusively when referring to colleagues. One way to avoid offending is to use “he or she” or “him or her,” for instance. But, as you can see, that can be awkward. Many writers, for that reason, use the plural, or interchange gender pronouns. It’s also a good idea to choose the sexually neutral word over the traditional equivalent. For instance, “chair” or “chairperson” works just as well as the commonly used “chairman.” 

> The geographical distribution of the Germanic languages, of which English is one, has been more extensive than that of any other group of languages. 

## Living Language

American English, like other living languages, is in constant transition. It is ever adjusting to reflect the changes in society. The alterations in the language can be controversial and have drawn some criticism from purists who wish to retain the form they learned initially. Yet the reality is that English borrows words from other languages incessantly, sometimes with the foreign pronunciation and sometimes without, adhering more to the standards for American English pronunciation. Immigrants bring terminology that quickly gets absorbed into the vernacular; new ideas receive new labels; and words are regularly shortened and combined with other words. And so language alters itself. 

Unlike many other nations, the United States has no official organization to prevent the language from changing. Indeed, the language has been called a polyglot; that is, it has a vocabulary stemming from myriad languages, a vocabulary that is ever-evolving. It’s easy to let this phenomenon bog you down—even overwhelm you. Try not to let it; concentrate on the logic of what you have to say to whom and strive to write clearly and precisely. Let the language be the common denominator in communication. That means using language your audience understands.
