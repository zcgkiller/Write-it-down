# 2 Connecting Writer and Reader
People who assess it overwhelmingly point to one problem in writing: a lack of understanding of and perception about the audience. Knowing whom your documents address and what response you want is a key to successful technical writing. This kind of writing informs people of past activities, findings, and decisions; it presents data and makes recommendations; it provides records of ongoing projects; it tells people how and why to take certain actions; it tells what kind of outcome is likely from intended actions; and it always has an audience — sometimes immediate and well known, other times projected. Often documents directed to a future audience go to immediate readers who need the information for interim work processes.

You can create grammatically correct and efficient passages that offer the information you need to convey. But overlooking the effects of your words on your readers is all too easy. That’s why, when you write, you need to step back and evaluate the readers. Who are they? How will they respond to the information you’re giving? Most people run the risk of not being objective about their readers, because when they write they are much more involved with what they have to say than they are with how readers will receive it.

This holds particularly true in the technical disciplines, where an initial reader may have knowledge of a project equal to that of the writer, but the intended audience may not be privy to the underlying details of a project. Other documents, such as technical notes, have no direct or immediate audience, and the intent is to supply a record of a problem resolved or record an issue. Nevertheless, while you may not know *now* who will seek a future record, you can assume someone will, so you will need to include enough background information to make the message understandable to the possible future reader.

The laboratory notebook is a good example of writing that’s done for an immediate audience: those persons coordinating projects and overseeing routine activities who are in positions to make decisions. Should the data in the notebook lead to significant discovery, then the data in the notebook become the foundation for development. So future audiences may include anyone who seeks a record of a project, including a regulatory body such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Thus, information must be clear, complete, and comprehensible to all pertinent, possible readers, not just the immediate ones.

>The palest ink is better than the best memory.
>							——Chinese proverb

Similarly, you may write a report to inform a scientific area of the company of a project’s progress, but a projected audience may well be a regulatory body who will look at the report at some point in the future. Thus, it’s smart to include information that the projected audience may require for complete understanding — but which is, nevertheless, not crucial for your immediate audience. Consider the case of a Quality Assurance (QA) Director who served as the project lead in the validation of a renovated plant facility. He included far more background and information than he had to for the simple reason that the facility would eventually be subject to a compliance inspection. He deemed it best to capture the complete history of the renovated facility, because he did not want to be in the position of having to recreate it at a future point.

A dossier that goes to a regulatory agency for review and product approval usually includes a large number of supporting documents, such as those prepared as the development progressed often over a period of ten years or more. When information is summarized, such as within individual portions of a New Drug Application (NDA) or Common Technical Document (CTD), writers really won’t know who the precise readers will be for the sections or their supporting documents. There may be many readers who will read various sections of a submission. For instance, a reviewer at FDA for a Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls (CMC) section of a submission will most probably not be the same reviewer as the one who looks at clinical data. And neither reviewer will have seen the supporting study documents when they were actually written. Those will have had a more immediate audience at the time the actual study reached completion. The common link here is usually the project manager at the agency who has been working with the company’s regulatory people and providing insight and suggestions for compiling the submission. And that dialog should set the tone for the writing.

Questions to ask before putting pen to paper — or booting up the computer — are the following:

- Who are the immediate readers?

- Who may read this document in the future?

- How much do the immediate readers already know about the topic?

- What do future readers need to know to understand the topic?

- What response do you want? 

Consider this passage from a Chemical Hygiene Plan. It is incomplete and vague. What is missing that the readers need to know? How can it be more explicit and direct?

> Where there is no immediate danger to the skin from contact with a hazardous chemical, it is still prudent to select clothing to minimize exposed skin surfaces. A laboratory coat should be worn over street clothes and be laundered regularly. A laboratory coat is intended to prevent contact with direct, chemical dusts, and minor chemical splashes of spills. If it becomes contaminated, it should be removed immediately and affected skin surface washed thoroughly. Employees should wear long legged clothing and avoid short trousers or skirts to cover areas that lab coats do not. Shoes should be worn in the laboratory at all times. Sandals and perforated shoes are not permitted in the laboratory. In addition long hair should be confined.

The above passage falls short because it does not directly address the readers and does not follow through in its directive. Further, the passage does not include related information the readers need. Who launders the lab coats? In the following rewrite, there is no question. The rewrite also gets rid of the conditional (“should be”), speaks directly to the reader, and tells how to follow through.

>Where there is no immediate danger to the skin from contact with a hazardous chemical, it is still prudent to select clothing to minimize the risk of exposure. Wear clothing with long legs to cover areas that lab coats do not. Avoid short pants or skirts to minimize exposure risk. Wear socks and closed shoes at all times; do not wear sandals and perforated shoes. In addition, confine long hair for your safety and to prevent compromising the integrity of the lab work. In addition, do not wear jewelry that can catch in laboratory equipment. Most important, always wear a laboratory coat over street clothes. Laboratory coats prevent contact with dirt, chemical dusts, and minor chemical splashes or spills. Always wear clean laboratory coats and dispatch soiled ones to the hamper bins in the change room.<br>Note: If you suspect your lab coat has become contaminated, remove it immediately, bag it, and wash all exposed skin surfaces thoroughly. Refer to the MSDS sheet for any additional measures. Call the Chemical Hygiene Officer to collect the contaminated lab coat.
