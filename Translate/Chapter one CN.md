# 1 Writing Within the Regulated Environment 法规环境下的写作

As far as most regulatory bodies are concerned, if you didn’t write it down, it didn’t happen. Working in the pharmaceutical, medical device, or biologic milieu is tantamount to journal keeping. In fact, “Write it down” sums up what it takes to get the job done properly. Successful operations require a working union of the day-to-day activities that keep the wheels of the business turning and the documentation that affirms those activities.

就大多数监管机构而言，如果你没有将其书写下来，那就等于没有发生。在制药、医疗器械或生物制品领域工作等同于进行日志记录。事实上，“写下来”概括了正确完成工作所需的步骤。成功的运营需要将业务运转的日常活动与确认这些活动的文件工作有机结合在一起。

Documents show the framework of a company’s varied activities. When the development process for one product is winding down, for example, and a submission is forthcoming, development processes for other products may be in various stages of development, from discovery through final testing in clinical trials and launch. Concurrently, other company products may be in various stages of scale-up or production. For each product in each phase of development or production, there must be a written history that shows control of all activities related to that product. Thus, the answer to “What did the company do in March (or on Tuesday) in the production of acetaminophen?” should be easily available in the records the company keeps.

文件记录显示了公司各种活动的框架。例如，当一个产品的开发过程接近尾声并准备提交时，其他产品的开发过程可能正处于不同的发展阶段，从发现阶段到在临床试验中的最终测试和上市。与此同时，其他公司的产品可能正处于不同阶段的规模扩大或生产中。对于每个产品的每个开发或生产阶段，都必须有一份书面历史记录，显示了与该产品相关的所有活动的控制情况。因此，对于“公司在三月份（或星期二）在对乙酰氨基酚的生产中做了什么？”的问题，应该在公司保留的记录中很容易找到答案。

The sheer volume of documentation that takes place makes writing well a critical skill, one that is essential for success. It is also true that writing is intimidating for many people. Perhaps because writing is so closely scrutinized, people are loath to commit their words to paper. If writing is on your list of job responsibilities, there are some avenues you can take to make the task less formidable. The first is gaining an understanding of why you are writing and how that writing works in conjunction with other documentation. The next is obtaining the tools you need to deliver clear and complete messages that are grammatically correct and consistent. Acquiring the requisite tools is what this book is all about.

大量的文档使写作成为一项至关重要的技能，这对成功至关重要。 确实，写作对许多人来说是令人生畏的。 也许是因为对写作进行了如此严格的审查，所以人们不愿将自己的文字写在纸上。 如果您的工作职责中包括写作，那么您可以采取一些方法来减轻任务的艰巨性。 首先是要了解为什么要写作以及该写作如何与其他文档一起工作。 接下来是获得传递语法正确且一致的清晰完整消息所需的工具。 本书所涉及的就是获得必要的工具。

大量的文件编写使得写作成为一项至关重要的关键技能，这是成功所必需的。同时，写作对于许多人来说也是令人生畏的。也许是因为写作受到如此严密的审查，人们不愿将他们的言辞写在纸上。如果写作是你的工作职责之一，有一些途径可以帮助你减轻这项任务的可怕感。首先，要理解你为什么要写以及你的写作与其他文档如何协同工作。接下来是获取所需的工具，以提供明确、完整、语法正确和一致的信息。获得必要的工具正是本书的主旨。

## Writing for Compliance with Binding Regulations 遵守约束性法规的写作

Why does writing play such an integral part in companies that develop, manufacture, and market therapeutic products? The answer lies largely with the regulatory forces that drive the healthcare industry in the United States and abroad.

为什么写作在开发、制造和销售治疗产品的公司中如此重要？答案在很大程度上与驱动美国和其他地方的医疗保健行业的监管力量有关。

The regulations state what companies must do. Their documentation tells how they do it and what the outcomes are. In a pharmaceutical company, for instance, documentation is the proof that a company’s activities meet the regulatory demands of Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations Part 211, Good Manufacturing Practices for Finished Pharmaceuticals. In this environment, documents delineate such diverse activities as facility and equipment qualification, cleaning, and maintenance; control of materials, from incoming components to finished goods; validation of manufacturing processes; sampling and testing activities; nonconformance and out-of-specification (OOS) investigations; and employee training. They provide the “how-to” for auditing vendors and contractors, handling complaints and recalls, and conducting annual product reviews. In short, documents substantiate that a company has complete control of all of its activities in compliance with the regulations.

法规规定了公司必须做什么。 他们的文档告诉他们如何做以及结果如何。 例如，证明一家制药公司的活动符合《联邦法规法典》主题21第211部分“药品良好生产规范”法规要求的证据就是文件。 在这种环境下，文件描述了各种活动，例如设施和设备的确认、清洁和维护、 从进料到成品的物料控制、生产工艺验证、取样和检验活动、 不合格和超限（OOS）调查以及员工培训等。 它们为审核供应商和承包商，处理投诉和召回以及进行年度产品回顾提供了“方法”。 简而言之，文件证明公司完成了遵守法规所需的受控活动。

In the United States (US), 21 CFR Part 820 Quality System Regulation delineates the Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs) for medical devices and Part 606 Good Manufacturing Practice for Blood and Blood Components delineates them for biologics. Most countries have similar regulations to ensure the safety and efficacy of products. Canada, for instance has the Canadian Health Protectorate Branch (CHPB), Ireland has the Irish Medicines Board (IMB), the United Kingdom has the Committee on Safety and Medicine (CSM), Australia has the Australian Code of GMP for Therapeutic Goods, and Japan has the Ministry of Health and Welfare (MHW). In numerous other countries, regulations come from the Ministry of Health (MOH).

在美国，21 CFR第820部分《质量体系法规》描述了医疗器械的良好制造规范（GMP），第 606部分《血液和血液成分的良好制造规范》则对生物制品进行了阐述。 大多数国家都有类似的规定，以确保产品的安全性和有效性。 例如，加拿大设有加拿大健康保护局（CHPB），爱尔兰设有爱尔兰药品管理局（IMB），英国设有安全和药品委员会（CSM），澳大利亚设有澳大利亚治疗性药品GMP规范，以及 日本设有厚生省（MHW）。 在许多其他国家，法规来自卫生部（MOH）。

While countries have their own regulatory authorities for ensuring safety and efficacy in drugs, devices, and biologics, they are also recognizing that internationally acceptable standards can help put products into world markets. Companies conducting clinical trials worldwide embrace the International Conference for Harmonisation (ICH) Guidelines, established in 1964 and revised in 1975 and 1986. These guidelines, which have their origins in the Declaration of Helsinki, present an international standard for designing, conducting, recording, and reporting clinical trials in which human subjects are participants. They were developed in consideration of the clinical practices of the European Union (EU), Japan, the United States, Australia, Canada, the Nordic countries, and the World Health Organization.

尽管各国都有自己的监管机构来确保药物，器械和生物制剂的安全性和有效性，但它们也认识到国际上可接受的标准可以帮助将产品推向世界市场。 在全球范围内进行临床试验的公司都采用国际协调会议（ICH）指南，该指南成立于1964年，并于1975年和1986年进行了修订。这些指南起源于《赫尔辛基宣言》，为涉及人类受试者的临床试验的设计，进行，记录， 报告提供了国际标准。 它们的开发考虑了欧盟（EU），日本，美国，澳大利亚，加拿大，北欧国家和世界卫生组织的临床实践。

In Europe, the European Medicines Evaluation Agency represents 15 member nations. The International Organisation for Standardization (ISO) promulgates standards for quality worldwide and offers certification. And Mutual Recognition Agreements (MRAs) between nations also attest to the drive toward uniform, internationally accepted standards for therapeutic products development.

在欧洲，欧洲药品局代表15个成员国。 国际标准化组织（ISO）颁布了全球质量标准并提供认证。 国家之间的相互认可协议（MRA）也证明了国际认可的治疗产品开发标准趋于统一。

One manifestation of this sort of standardization is the Common Technical Document (CTD). Many nations now mandate the CTD as the vehicle for gaining approval to market a drug, biologic, or device. Some countries recommend and will accept the format, but until they change the regulations in place, they do not make it a formal requirement. Until FDA, for instance, makes a revision to 21 CFR Part 314, NDA it won’t be mandatory to submit a New Drug Application (NDA) in the CTD format. The outline for the CTD allows companies to devise one document that they can submit to many countries for product approval. The variable piece is the section on Quality Assurance. (See Chapter Eight for more information about the CTD.)

这种标准化的一种体现是通用技术文档（CTD）。 现在，许多国家/地区要求CTD作为获得批准销售药物，生物制品或设备的工具。 一些国家建议并接受该格式，但是在他们更改现行法规之前，还没有将其作为正式的要求。 例如，在FDA对21 CFR Part 314（NDA）进行修订之前，强制要求以CTD格式提交新药申请（NDA）。 CTD的大纲使公司可以设计一份文件，可以提交给许多国家进行产品批准。 可变部分是“质量保证”部分。 （有关CTD的更多信息，请参见第八章。）

Few, if any, companies are driven by just one set of regulations. A typical US pharmaceutical company may be subject to the regulatory guidelines set forth by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in Title 21 CFR Parts 210 and 211 as well as those set forth by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the Department of Transportation (DOT), and various other state and federal organizations. If it seeks to manufacture or market a product outside the US, it must look to the binding regulations in targeted countries.

只有很少的公司（如果有的话）仅受一套法规的约束。 典型的美国制药公司可能要遵守美国食品药品管理局（FDA）在21 CFR第210和211部分以及美国环境保护署（EPA），缉毒局（ DEA），职业安全与健康管理局（OSHA），交通部（DOT）以及其他各种州和联邦组织颁布的法规要求。 如果要在美国以外生产或销售产品，则必须遵守目标国家/地区的约束性法规。

Once in place, regulations don’t change all that rapidly. However, it takes about five years for industry standards to develop. Once a regulatory agency issues a regulation, dialog among companies and FDA takes place, and industry “best practices” develop. Consider, for example, 21 CFR Part 11, Electronic Records; Electronic Signatures. This regulation, vague in nature, has generated tremendous discussion, and FDA has issued many guidances as to how the law is to be interpreted. Industry standards are now in place for this regulation, although discussion continues. More recently, the US Department of Public Welfare and Human Services issued 45 CFR Parts 160, 162, and 164 for electronic record keeping of patient records. This regulation bridges into FDA-regulated industries, since developers of therapeutics engaged in clinical trials manage patient data. These regulations, part of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), are new, and industry standards are developing. However, companies seeking to comply will do well to understand industry standards for Part 11, since the regulations are parallel, even though issued by separate agencies.

法规一旦制定，就不会很快改变。但是（由法规）形成行业标准大约需要5年时间。当监管机构颁布法规后，企业与FDA之间的对话就会展开，行业的“最佳实践”也将逐步完善。例如，21CFR第11部分，电子记录与电子签名，因为其本身含混不清，引起了极大的争论，FDA发布了许多解释应当如何执行该法规的指南。该法规的行业标准已经制定，但争论仍在继续。最近（2005年，本书写作时间），美国公共福利与人类服务部发布了45 CFR 第 160、162和164部分，用于规范保存患者病历的电子记录。该法规一只脚跨进了FDA监管的行业，因为新疗法临床试验的开发人员管理受试者的病历。这些新的法规是《健康保险可移植性和责任法案》（HIPAA）的一部分，相应的行业标准正在制定中。但是，那些寻求遵守（这些法规）的公司将更容易理解第11部分的行业标准，虽然法规由不同部门颁布，但是法规（的内涵）是相似的。

Further, companies must also understand that new regulations don’t supersede existing ones. Predicate rules, those already in place, still apply. Thus, companies complying with 21 CFR Part 11 must continue to follow the regulations that drive their operations. If a medical device manufacturer goes to electronic record keeping, the guidelines for the records themselves reside in 21 CFR Part 820. This is the way most regulations work.

此外，公司还要了解新法规不会取代已有法规。既有规则（那些在原来法规已经存在的规则）仍然适用。因此，遵守21 CFR 11部分的公司必须继续遵守推动其运营的法规，如果医疗设备制造商要进行电子记录保存，则记录本身的准则位于21 CFR 820部分中。这是大多数法规的工作方式。

Managing the regulatory maze is not easy. Yet keeping abreast of the regulations and remaining compliant makes good business sense. Monthly publications for industry, available by subscription, detail issues in the industry and governmental rulings. Industry forums, conferences, and courses offered by professional training organizations offer opportunities to remain current. It’s not enough to adhere to the regulations. Companies need to understand the direction in which compliance is moving and keep in step. The last thing a company needs is a routine investigation that discovers nonstandard practices. The result will be a discrepancy observation, citing what needs to be fixed. It’s always better to have everything in place, with documented proof that it is, rather than to scramble to fix what the company has been cited for—this slows productivity and makes poor business sense. One thing is abundantly clear: Documentation will continue to be critical to every facet of doing business within this highly regulated environment.

管理法规迷宫并不容易。 但是，与法规保持一致并保持合规性具有良好的商业意义。可通过订阅获得的行业月刊，详细列出了行业和政府裁决中的问题。专业培训组织提供的行业论坛，会议和课程提供了保持最新状态的机会。 仅仅遵守法规是不够的。公司需要了解合规性发展的方向，并与时俱进。 公司需要做的最后一件事是发现不规范做法的例行调查。 结果将是差异性观察，并指出了需要解决的问题。 最好将所有内容都放在适当的位置，并附上有据可查的证据，而不是为了确定公司被引用的内容而争先恐后地进行，这会降低生产率并降低商业意义。 有一件事很清楚：在这个受到严格监管的环境中，文档对于开展业务的各个方面仍然至关重要。

<b>Regulatory Evolution in the United States美国的法规演变</b></p>
<p style='margin-left:1em;'>Laws governing therapeutic product development and marketing have evolved over time with specific laws marking milestones over a period of 100-plus years. The first US federal regulation dates back to 1884 when American soldiers died after ingesting adulterated quinine. As a result of these deaths, the government passed the Drug Importation Act, which required customs inspections on drugs coming from overseas. Then in 1901, The Biologic Control Act became law after 13 children died from a contaminated antitoxin for diphtheria. This act gave the government regulatory power over antitoxin and vaccine development. Shortly after, in 1906, the government passed the Food and Drugs Act to authorize the government to monitor food purity and safety of medicines. </p>
<p style='margin-left:1em;'>管理治疗产品开发和销售的法律在过去的100年间随着时间不断发展，里程碑就是那些特定的法律。美国第一个联邦法规可以追溯到1884年，当时美国士兵摄取了掺假的奎宁后死亡。因为这些士兵的死亡，政府通过了《药品进口法案》，要求海关对那些来自海外的药品进行检查。1901年，因为13名儿童死于受污染的白喉抗毒素，《生物制品控制法案》成为法律。该法案赋予了政府对抗毒素和疫苗开发的监管权。不久之后，1906年，政府通过了《食品与药品法案》，授权政府对食品的纯度和药品安全性进行监管。</p>
<p style='margin-left:1em;'>In 1931, the Food and Drugs Act was renamed the Food and Drug Administration. Several other events were significant in developing binding regulations designed to protect humans and animals. The 1932 Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis in the Negro Male, conducted under the auspices of the US Public Health Service, deprived infected men of effective treatment so as not to interrupt the project. Then in 1937, 107 people died after taking “elixir of sulfanilamide,” which turned out to be an antifreeze solution. FDA removed the product from the market, not because it caused fatalities, but because it was mislabeled. In 1938, the government passed the Food, Drug, and Cosmetics Act. This Act expanded the role of FDA to control of cosmetics and devices.</p>
<p style='margin-left:1em;'>1931年，《食品与药品法案》更名为《食品与药品管理法》。其他几项重大事件对于制定旨在保护人类和动物的约束性法规也很重要。1932年，在美国公共卫生局主持下的塔斯基吉梅毒研究为了避免项目中断，剥夺了黑人受感染男性的有效治疗。（注：塔斯基吉梅毒实验是美国公共卫生局性病部门在1932年至1972年间于阿拉巴马州与当地历史悠久的黑人大学塔斯基吉大学合作，对近399名非洲裔男性梅毒患者及201名健康非洲裔男性所进行的一系列人体试验。这些实验参与者皆为生活贫困的阿拉巴马州梅肯县佃农。该实验以提供免费医疗、餐点、丧葬保险以吸引居民参与实验，也以此目的募集基金。但在经济大萧条导致经费补助中断后，参与者将不再有机会接受任何医学治疗，但研究者仍在未告知参与者的情况下继续进行实验。自始至终，研究者都不曾对罹患梅毒的参与者告知罹患梅毒的实情，而是宣称患者接受的治疗是为了医治败血症，也从不曾施予参与者有效的治疗方式。实验开始之初，梅毒还是无药可医的绝症；但1943年，医学界发现青霉素可有效医治梅毒后，研究人员为了使该实验继续进行，故意不对患者施以有效治疗手段，甚至企图阻止参与实验的梅毒患者接受有效治疗。此实验一直持续在相关领域期刊发表研究报告，少数学者呼吁终止该实验，却遭无视；一直到1972年，实验知情人向大众媒体揭发，该实验才终止。美国政府则迟至1997年才对受害者作出赔偿及公开道歉。）1937年，又有107人因服用磺胺醑剂死亡，最后归结原因为防冻液。（注：即二甘醇，有甜味，可与水混溶，工业上可用作防冻剂。在本次事件中，药剂师哈罗德·沃特金斯用工业溶剂二甘醇代替乙醇和糖，造成358人肾衰竭、107人中毒死亡，其中大部分是儿童。美国联邦法院决定对制药公司罚款26000美元，药剂师沃特金斯在内疚和绝望中自杀。）FDA从市场上移除了该产品，不是因为它造成的死亡，而是因为它的标签错误。（注：根据当时的法律，FDA只能如此处理）1938年，政府通过了《食品、药品和化妆品法案》，该法案将FDA的监管权限扩展到了化妆品和医疗器械。</p>
<p style='margin-left:1em;'>It was during World War II, however, that experiments were done in large scale on unconsenting humans. The Nuremberg War Crime Trials brought these atrocities to light, and the result was the Nuremberg Code, which cited ten standards for ethical human research. </p>
<p style='margin-left:1em;'>然而，在二战期间进行了大量未经同意的人体试验。战后，纽伦堡战争罪行审判揭露了这些暴行，并最终形成纽伦堡法典，里面列举了人体研究的十大道德标准。</p>
<p style='margin-left:1em;'>A wake-up call for even better monitoring came in 1962, when thousands of babies were born with defects, the result of their mothers taking thalidomide while pregnant. The drug had never been approved for marketing in the US, but was undergoing research in American women. Of these women, nine gave birth to defective infants. This event induced FDA to require notification of investigational use of drugs, which up until this time, had not been required. The result was the Kefauver-Harris Amendment to the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. </p>
<p style='margin-left:1em;'>1962年，人们开始呼吁进行更有力的监管，当时成千上万的婴儿出生时有缺陷，这是由于母亲在怀孕期间服用了沙利度胺。沙利度胺从未在美国获准上市，但是当时在美国女性中正进行临床试验。这些（参加试验的）女性，共有9个生下了有缺陷的婴儿。这次事件导致FDA要求通知药物的研究用途，在当时还没有该项要求。沙利度胺事件最终促成了《科夫沃-哈里斯修正案》的出台。</p>
<p style='margin-left:1em;'>At about the same time, President John F. Kennedy announced the Consumer Bill of Rights in a message to Congress. This Bill of Rights said that people have the right to safety, the right to be informed, the right to choose, and the right to be heard. In the same period, in 1964, the World Medical Association issued the Declaration of Helsinki, and physicians were tasked with embracing this statement: “The health of my patients will be my first consideration.” The declaration has been amended four times, and the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) has incorporated the basic elements. </p>
<p style='margin-left:1em;'>大约在同一时间，约翰·肯尼迪总统（John F. Kennedy）在致国会的消息中宣布了《消费者权益法案》。这份权利法案称，人们有权享有安全权，知情权，选择权和发表意见的权利。在同一时期，世界医师协会于1964年发布《赫尔辛基宣言》，医生被要求接受这样的声明：我将患者的健康作为我的首要考虑。《宣言》已经修订了四次，联邦法规（CFR）已经包含了其基本要素.</p>
<p style='margin-left:1em;'>In 1972, the National Institutes of Health transferred the regulation of biologics to FDA. This was followed by the National Research Act, which created the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research. Additional legislation has continued to promote ethical treatment of healthcare recipients. In 1978, FDA published the current Good Manufacturing Practices, 21 CFR Parts 210 and 211. </p>
<p style='margin-left:1em;'>1972年，国立卫生研究院（NIH）将生物制品的监管移交给了FDA。随之而来的是《国家研究法》，该法设立了国家人类医学生物医学和行为研究保护委员会。进一步的立法持续促进医疗保健接受者的道德待遇。1978年，FDA发布了现行的《良好生产规范》（cGMP），21 CFR 210和211部分。</p>
<p style='margin-left:1em;'>In 1988, the FDA became an agency of the Department of Health and Human Services. Since that time, the ICH has been formed. A significant ICH goal is to maintain safeguards on quality, safety, efficacy, and regulatory obligation for the protection of the public. The 1997 Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act reauthorized the Prescription Drug User Fee Act of 1992 and instituted reforms in agency practices. In 1996, medical devices became subject to Quality System Regulation (QSR) 21 CFR Part 820. In 1996, as well, the Department of Health and Human Services enacted HIPAA into law. This provided the forward momentum for broad changes in the healthcare industry, but the specifics of the regulation were still being written. Shortly thereafter, in 1997, 21 CFR Part 11 Electronic Records; Electronic Signatures was enacted. </p>
<p style='margin-left:1em;'>1988年，FDA成为卫生与公共服务部的下属机构。那时，ICH已经成立。 它的一个重要目标就是保护公众，维护（药品）质量，安全性，功效和监管义务方面的保障措施。1997年，《FDA现代化法案》重新授权了1992年的《处方药使用者付费法》（PDUFA，该法案有一项“日落条款”，如果国会不重新授权，它将在五年后失效。每五年必须重新商讨该条款，其中可能包括讨论该机构是否需要更多资金、FDA 是否履行了其承诺、行业是否应该持有不同的期望，或者FDA 是否需要以不同的方式传达其期望。）并改革FDA。1996年，医疗器械成为质量体系法规（QSR）21 CFR 820部分的主体。1996年，卫生与公共服务部也将HIPAA颁布为法律。 这为医疗保健行业的广泛变革提供了前进的动力，但该法规的具体内容仍在撰写中（本书成稿时）。此后不久，在1997年21 CFR 11部分“电子记录与电子签名”发布。</p>
<p style='margin-left:1em;'>The government does not issue laws without forethought. The Office of the Federal Register issues the Federal Register (FR), a weekly disclosure publication that informs citizens of their rights and obligations by providing access to the official text of approved regulations and descriptions of federal organizations, programs, and activities. It also publishes texts of proposed regulations and changes to existing regulations. This gives industry the opportunity to react and share dialog with the government agency that has ownership of the proposal. Reviewers can comment on content and wording, the date the regulation goes into effect, and the penalties for noncompliance. Comments are reviewed in a government forum, and the final text becomes the “final rule.”</p>
<p style='margin-left:1em;'>政府不会在没有深思熟虑的情况下颁布法律。联邦纪事办公室发布《联邦纪事》（FR），这是每周公开的出版物，通过提供已批准法规的正式文本以及对联邦组织，计划和活动的描述，向公民通报其权利和义务。它还公布的法规提案文本及对现行法规的修改。这使业界有机会与拥有提案所有权的政府机构进行反馈并与他们对话。审阅者可以评论内容和措辞，法规生效的日期以及对违规行为的处罚。评论在政府论坛中进行审核，最终文本成为“最终规则”。</p>
<p style='margin-left:1em;'>Once enacted, laws are published in the CFR, issued annually on April 1. Laws are enforceable by the respective divisions within the Department of Health and Human Services. It’s important to note, however, that once a final rule appears in the FR, companies are responsible for instituting compliance. Thus, keeping abreast of the regulations requires constant vigilance. </p>
<p style='margin-left:1em;'>（提案）一旦成为法律，将在每年4月1日出版的CFR中发布，具体由卫生和公共服务部内的各个部门执行。不过，请务必注意，一旦最终规则出现在FR中，公司就有责任建立合规性。因此，与法规保持同步需要时刻保持关注。</p>
<p style='margin-left:1em;'>The CFR contains regulations of specific government departments and agencies. The CFR has 50 “Titles,” each assigned to a different unit of government. Title 21, Food and Drugs, contains regulations mandated by FDA. Title 45, Public Welfare, falls under the auspices of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Each title of the CFR is then divided into chapters, and each chapter is divided into parts and subparts. </p>
<p style='margin-left:1em;'>CFR包含特定政府部门和机构的法规。CFR有50个“主题”，每个主题都分配给不同的政府部门。章节21，食品和药品，包含由FDA执行的法规。章节45，公众福利，由国立卫生研究院（NIH）主持。CFR的每个主题分为若干章节，并将每一章节分为多个部分和子部分</p>
<p style='margin-left:1em;'>Remember, too, that as new regulations are enacted, they do not supersede existing regulations unless the government has rescinded them. New regulations in essence become adjuncts to the ones already in place. Companies must adhere to predicate rules and remain vigilant about industry best practices for compliance.</p>
<p style='margin-left:1em;'>还要记住，新法规颁布后，除非政府取消了旧法规，否则它们不会取代现有法规。从本质上讲，新法规成为现有法规的补充。 公司必须遵守既有规则，并对行业最佳实践时刻保持关注。</p>

## Document, Document, Document 文件，文件，还是文件
Documents work with each other either concurrently or in tandem. Documents tell how things happen on a regular basis and present a “big picture” of a company’s operations, usually in standard operating procedures (SOPs), quality manuals, plans, and other such documents. Documents such as protocols and proposals tell what the company plans to do. Ongoing assessment and data recording occurs as activities progress. Process reports give the results of projects. Finally, summary reports bring it all together — what is the outcome of a significant set of activities?

文件可以同时或串联在一起工作。文件会定期说明事情的发生方式，并通常通过标准操作程序（SOP），质量手册，计划和其他此类文件来呈现公司运营的“全景”。方案和提议之类的文件说明了公司计划采取的措施。随着活动的进行，持续进行评估和数据记录。 过程报告给出了项目的结果。最后，汇总报告将所有内容汇总在一起-一系列重要活动的结果是什么？

A single product’s history may start with source data for the concept, usually a laboratory finding. After the initial discovery recorded in the laboratory notebook comes testing to see if the concept is viable. Countless
studies, performed in accordance with binding regulations, such as Good Laboratory Practices (GLPs), result in decisions to pursue the product development or to abandon it. When a company determines to develop a product, preclinical testing helps to confirm the potential product’s value and determine whether the company should file for approval to test the product in humans in controlled clinical trials.

单个产品的历史记录可能始于该概念的源数据，通常是实验室发现的数据。在实验室记录本中记录了最初发现之后，需要进行测试以查看该概念是否可行。在按照具有约束力的法规——例如良好实验室规范（GLP）——进行了无数次研究后，根据结果最终决定进行产品开发还是放弃产品开发。当公司决定开发一个产品时，临床前测试有助于确认潜在产品的价值，并确定公司是否应递交申请在受控的临床试验中在人体进行产品测试。

If the product moves through clinical trials, the company files for approval to manufacture and market the product. At every step in this process, which can easily take a decade, documentation captures what happens. Once a product is in the marketplace, record keeping continues, and stability studies confirm continuing efficacy through the expiry date on the product. Careful and continual monitoring must occur, and if a product loses its efficacy or has other problems, the company may issue a field alert or recall. The
company keeps the product records at least two years beyond the shelf life of the product itself.

如果该产品通过临床试验，公司将（向管理当局）申请批准生产和销售该产品。在此过程中的每一步（很容易花费十年时间），文档都会记录发生的情况。产品上市后，将继续保持记录，并且进行稳定性研究确认在产品有效期内持续（发挥）效力。必须（对产品）进行仔细且连续的监控，如果产品失去功效或存在其他问题，则公司可能会发出现场警示或召回产品。公司需要将产品记录保存到产品本身有效期到期后至少两年。

>Companies need to keep extensive records of everything they do, whether it becomes part of the final product development or not. They need to know what didn’t work so they don’t go down the same road twice.
>无论(工作）是否成为最终产品开发的一部分，公司都必须保留所做工作的详尽记录。 他们需要知道哪些方法无效，这样他们就不会在同一地方跌倒两次。
>——John Cline, Ph.D. 约翰·克莱恩博士


Companies must show their control of systems, processes, and products in documentation. This means self-monitoring and assessment, as well as change management. There is no “magic formula” for documentation for all companies, but the common denominator is this: Companies must have controls in place, and they must have records of what they do, have done, and plan to do.

公司必须在文件中显示对系统，流程和产品的控制。 这意味着自我监控和评估以及变更管理。没有“万能公式”可以适用于所有公司的文档，但是共同点是：公司必须有适当的控制权，并且必须有关于自己所做，已经做的和计划做的记录。

Critical to successful operations are trained employees, so training must also be a documented part of operations. In addition to the orientation employees receive about their jobs when they are hired, they must receive regular “refresher” training, as well as retraining as procedures change or as they move from position to position within a company. Similarly, companies must verify that consultants have the appropriate training for the roles they fulfill and that vendors and contractors meet the criteria for the quality standards set by the company.

成功运营的关键是受过培训的员工，因此培训也必须成为运营中有据可查的一部分。除了雇用员工时要接受的入职培训外，他们还必须接受定期的“复习”培训，以及随着流程变化或在公司内部从一个职位变动到另一个职位而接受的再培训。同样，公司必须确认已经对顾问进行了与其所担任的角色适当的培训，并且供应商和承包商均符合公司制定的质量标准。

In sum, compliance with the binding regulations requires extensive documentation, all of which reflects the activities a company carries out daily. As companies find better and better ways to do things, gain new technologies, and decide to manufacture products that require different formulas and procedures, they must both continue to meet current standards and verify, through records, their adherence.

总而言之，要遵守具有约束力的法规，需要大量反映了公司每天进行的活动的文档。当公司发现有越来越的方法做事，如获取新技术以及决定制造需要不同配方和程序的产品等，它们必须继续满足当前标准，并通过记录确认其遵守情况。

### Keeping the House in Order 让房子井然有序

Compliance with the binding regulations and clear and complete documentation should be the goals for all companies operating within regulatory statutes. Who will determine if they are being met? Companies can expect audits and inspections from many sources. FDA, for instance, sends investigators on site for two primary reasons: a general GMP inspection or a new product inspection. In a general GMP inspection, FDA is present to assess overall operations and determine a company’s adherence to GMPs. In this type of inspection, investigators may ask to observe production — but not developmental — processes. A preapproval, postapproval, or scale-up inspection, on the other hand, focuses primarily on facilities and processes relative to a new product. Preapproval, postapproval, and scale-up inspections comprise much of the FDA’s focus.

遵守具有约束力的法规以及清晰完整的文件应该是所有在法规内运营的公司的目标。谁来确定他们是否得到满足？ 公司可以期望从多方面进行审核和检查。例如，FDA派遣调查人员到现场是出于两个主要原因：普通GMP检查或新产品检查。在普通GMP检查中，FDA会评估整体运营并确定公司对GMP的遵守情况。在这种检查中，研究人员可能会要求观察生产过程，而不是产品开发过程。另一方面，批准前，批准后或放大生产检查主要集中在与新产品相关的设施和过程上。批准前，批准后和放大生产检查是FDA的重点工作。

Companies that successfully undergo inspections know that it’s difficult to anticipate the direction they may take; thus it’s always wise to have everything in place and running effectively. If, for instance, a company
employs electronic signatures, how the company has achieved compliance and maintains it will surely be a focus. Written records attest to what the company has done and what it continues to do.

成功通过检查的公司知道，很难预测他们（FDA）会采取的（检查）方向；因此，明智的做法是使一切就绪并有效运行。例如，如果公司使用电子签名，那么公司如何实现合规性并持续保持合规无疑将成为重点。书面记录证明了公司的所作所为和后续将要做的事情。

What an inspector does or doesn’t find marks the caliber of the company. Violations are not to be taken lightly. FDA considers a violation of cGMPs during an inspection an “incident.” If, upon reinspection, the same violation is present, FDA considers the violation a “practice,” and the product subsequently adulterated. These are serious issues, ones that good documentation reflecting good practices can very often prevent.

检查员发现或未发现的内容体现了公司的水平。不能轻视违规行为。FDA认为在检查过程中违反cGMP的行为是“事件”，以及随后的产品掺假。这些都是严重的问题，反映良好实践的优秀文件通常可以防止这些问题（发生）。

Companies must thus understand what controlled documentation they must have in place and accessible. For instance, to undergo a successful approval inspection, companies manufacturing drug products usually make the following core records available; other documents may accompany these, depending on the product and processes.

因此，公司必须了解他们必须拥有哪些可访问的受控文件。例如，若要成功通过批准检查，药品生产公司通常会提供以下核心记录；根据产品和工艺，可能会附带其他文件。

1. Manufacturing and controls segments of the application 申请中的生产和质量控制部分

2. Master formula 主处方

3. History section of the application 申请的历史

4. Development data, including product characteristics and physical properties, manufacturing procedures, finished product test results, dissolution profiles, and results of pilot and preliminary production-size batches that confirm formula ranges, specifications, in-process variables, and stability testing.

   研发数据，包括产品特性、物理性质、生产流程、最终产品的检测结果、溶出曲线、中试规模和初步生产规模批次的结果，可确认配方范围，规格，中控变量和稳定性测试。

5. Materials analyses 物料分析

6. Laboratory data 实验室数据

7. Equipment qualification and cleaning validation 设备确认与清洁验证

8. Standard Operating Procedures, including those for change control, QA/QC investigations, field alerts, and validation 标准操作规程（SOP），包括变更控制、QA/QC调查、现场警示与验证

9. Finished product test results 最终产品检测结果

10. Stability studies 稳定性研究

Note that a visit by FDA or another government agency is not the only time a company receives an inspection. A company may be the subject of an audit by a firm seeking contract services or a joint venture. Such an audit will likely be every bit as strenuous as other inspections, and, once more, having documented practices in place translates to doing good business.

注意FDA或其他政府部门并不是仅在检查的时候才会到访。公司可能是另一寻求合同服务或合资企业的公司的审计对象，这样的审计可能会像（迎接）其他检查一样耗费精力，然而一切文件记录在案的实践可以转化为好的商业机会。

## Document Control 文件控制

While this is not a book about document control, it’s important that writers understand that companies must control their documents and that writers must conform to the process in their companies. The systems vary from company to company, but effective companies know which documentation is drafted, written, under review, beginning revision, or moving into obsolescence. The degree of sophistication that characterizes the system is relative to the degree of sophistication of the company itself. A company with many sites needs systems that are more complex than those required by smaller companies.

尽管这不是一本关于文档控制的书，但文件的写作者必须了解公司控制文档并且必须符合公司流程的重要性。虽然公司之间的（文件）系统各不相同，但实际上公司都知道要起草，撰写，审核，开始修订或废止过时的文档。系统表现出的复杂程度与公司本身的复杂程度有关。拥有多个场地的公司所需要的系统比小型公司的更为复杂。

While there are many excellent systems, most share common ground. There are fixed procedures for introducing and approving the concept for a document, and drafting, reviewing it, and giving it final approval. Documents generally have other controls and are searchable by number, title, author, and key words. In addition, documents have revision histories, so a review of the document tells the life of the document from conception to retirement. Finally, who signs what type of document needs to be spelled
out. Usually companies develop a minimum required signature list that tells who has authority to sign what type of document and how many signatures are needed to approve the document. Companies typically detail how their systems work in an SOP on document management. They may also have instructions for writing specific documents such as study reports, audit reports, and submission documents. 

尽管有许多出色的系统，但大多数系统具有共同点。引入和批准概念文件，起草，审核以及最终批准文档都有固定的程序。文件通常还有其他控制方法并且可以通过编号、题目、作者和关键词搜索。另外，文件具有修订历史，因此，对文档进行回顾可以了解文档从最初概念提出到最终停止使用的整个过程。最后，需要说明具体某一类文件应当由谁签署。通常，公司会制定最低要求的签名列表，以告知某种类型的文件谁有权签署以及批准文件需要多少人签署。公司通常会在文件管理的SOP中详细说明其系统的工作方式。他们还可能有编写特定文件（例如研究报告，审计报告和提交文件）的说明。

Effective document management systems ensure that documents maintain their integrity. For instance, hard copies of documents — such as those in SOP manuals — are controlled, and when new documents are issued, previous versions are accounted for and destroyed. Approved, official copies of documents must reside in controlled environments with limited access — in a limited access area for manual systems or in software system vaults for electronic systems.

有效的文件管理系统可确保文件保持完整性。例如，文件的硬拷贝（例如SOP手册中的文件）受到控制，并且在发布新文件时，应当销毁以前的旧版本文件。批准的正式文件副本必须保存于访问受限的受控环境中-手动系统可在受限的访问区域内，电子系统可在软件系统的保管库中。

Companies must all define how their systems work. Documents in a manual system review process, for instance, may route through the system in colored folders, so reviewers know at a glance that the document in a yellow folder is a qualification, a document in a red folder an SOP, and a document
in a purple folder a laboratory method. Other systems may send documents as pdf files as attachments to e-mails for review with a scheduled concurrence meeting.

公司都必须定义其系统的工作方式。 例如，在手动系统审核过程中，文件可能会在彩色文件夹中通过整个系统，因此审阅者一眼便知道黄色文件夹中的是确认文件，红色文件夹中的是SOP，紫色文件夹中的是检测方法。其他系统可能会将pdf文件作为电子邮件的附件发送，以供预定的并发会议进行审核。

Electronic record keeping (ERK) is now mandated for patient records. Many small companies rely on manual systems, while others have implemented electronic document management systems. Electronic systems are necessary for electronic submissions to many regulating agencies, so the impetus is to go electronic. But more importantly, ERK provides more efficient document management overall and cuts down on the amount of paper companies must manage in their archives.

电子记录保存 (ERK) 现已强制要求用于病历。当有些公司已采用电子文档管理系统时，仍有许多小公司依赖于手动系统。向许多监管机构提交电子文件必须使用电子系统，电子化的发展也因此而被推动.但更加重要的是，ERK整体上提供了更高效的文件管理模式，并减少了公司必须在其档案中使用的纸张数量。

ERK systems require extensive controls. They must be validated for the intended use of the system. There must be controls in place to ensure security, user accountability, and audit trails. Many companies have put Computer Software Validation (CSV) teams in place to ensure that validation of software-driven systems happens effectively. Once a system has gone live, it undergoes audits, and when major changes occur, it undergoes full or partial revalidation.

ERK系统需要大量的控制措施。它们必须为系统的预期用途而得到验证。这里必须有控制措施，以确保安全、用户问责制和审计跟踪。许多公司会设立电脑软件验证团队以便确认软件驱动系统的验证得以有效进行。一旦系统投入使用，就会接受审计，当发生重大变化时，就会进行全面或部分的重新验证。

The bottom line for document management is this: Companies have to determine how their document management system works and then document it. Further, anyone working with documentation within the system needs to understand how the system works. That means system users must have training in the system and not deviate from it.

文档管理的底线是：公司必须确定他们的文件管理系统是如何运作的并将其记录。此外，任何在系统内处理文档的人都需要了解系统的工作方式。这意味着系统用户必须接受过系统培训并且不能偏离它

### Standard Formats 标准格式

Standardized formats also make documents easier to write and process for most companies. These formats can guide writers through the tasks of drafting and revising; they can guard against zealous rewrites by reviewers and can facilitate the approval process. Many companies have stylebooks that specify the presentation of certain information: These guides may call for a serial comma or not or direct certain SOP phraseology in delivering information common to many procedures, such as securing QA approval and signature. The extent to which companies control the details of documentation depends on each company’s resources. (See Chapter Nine for more information about style.)

对于大多数公司而言，标准格式也可以使文件撰写和处理变得更容易，这些格式可以指导写作者完成起草和修订的工作；它们也可以防止内容被审阅者重写来加快审批过程。许多公司都有指定特定信息表达的样例手册：这些手册可能要求使用连续的逗号或不使用逗号，或在提供许多程序中常见的信息时直接使用某些SOP措辞，如确保QA批准和签字。公司控制文件细节的程度取决于每个公司的资源。(关于样例的更多信息，见第九章）

Document control staff should be able to identify the location of a document in a system at any given time. Staff may also write documents relative to their area or serve in the review process. They may have license to make mechanical, but not content, changes before final approval. Once a document receives final approval, through either a series of review cycles or a concurrence meeting, document control staff should issue the document with no further change. The group should also retrieve previous versions of documents, if any, and provide a history of the document’s development. Document control involves exhaustive attention to detail but does not infringe on the integrity of the documents.

负责文档管理的工作人员应该在任何给定的时刻都能确定文档在系统中的位置。工作人员也可以编写与他们领域相关的文档或者参与审查过程。在文档被正式批准之前，他们有权限去进行格式化而非内容的修改。一旦文件通过一系列的审查或同意会议得到最终批准，文件控制人员应发布该文件，不得进一步更改。该小组还应该收回以前版本的文档（如果有的话），并提供文档演变的历史。文件控制涉及对细节的详尽关注，但不违背文件的完整性。
## The Writing Task 写作任务

Writing is hard work, and it is high on the list of what people hate to do most. For many, it’s an intimidating task. In regulated industries this can be especially true: You may find yourself in the position of having to document what has happened, what happens regularly, what will happen. Regardless of the focus, writing always requires accuracy, attention to detail, and clarity.

写作是一项艰苦的工作，而且它是人们最不喜欢做的事情之一。对许多人来说，写作是一项令人望而却步的任务。在受管制的行业中，这一点尤为明显：您可能会发现自己需要记录已经发生的事情、定期发生的事情以及将要发生的事情。无论写作的焦点是什么，准确性、细节关注和清晰度都是不可或缺的。

In this industry, few people write in solitary. You may be called upon to prepare a report, write a technical memo, review any number of documents, draft a report that requires the participation of several people, or compile information from many sources as a basis of study. How you tackle these tasks requires some foresight. Understanding the writing project you are about to undertake is the place to begin. You may be the primary author of an SOP, a collaborative author of a dossier, or one of several authors involved in a project such as a facilities validation. You may be the primary author of an activity, such as an audit, that requires a bevy of writing to reach a conclusion. (See the text box Put It in Writing.)

在这个行业中，很少有人独自写作。您可能需要准备报告、撰写技术备忘录、审查各种文件、起草需要多人参与的报告，或者根据多个信息来源编制研究基础。如何应对这些任务需要有一定的远见。了解即将承担的写作项目是开始的地方。您可能是标准操作程序（SOP）的主要作者，是一份档案的合作作者，或者是参与项目（如设施验证）的几位作者之一。您可能是一项活动（如审计）的主要作者，需要进行大量的写作工作以得出结论。（见文本框《书面表达》。）

The good news is that for many types of writing there are clear guidelines. For writing documents such as SOPs, you need to look to the company standards; the same holds true for validation documents. For other types of writing, you can look to the regulations, industry practices, and government issued guidances. Consider for instance, preparing a Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls (CMC) section of a submission for approval to market a solid-dose drug product. How will what you are to write fit into the big picture? The guideline for CMC breaks down the components into manageable groupings of information including (1) the drug substance, (2) the drug product, (3) methods validation, and (4) environmental assessment. Within each of these groupings are subgroupings. You can thus prepare components of each and assemble them accordingly. Of course, you’ll have to do your homework first. Make sure you fully understand what it is that you have to say.

好消息是，在许多类型的写作中都有明确的指导方针。对于编写SOP等文件，您需要遵循公司的标准；对于验证文件也是如此。对于其他类型的写作，您可以参考法规、行业实践和政府发布的指南。例如，考虑准备固体剂型药物市场批准提交的化学、制造和控制（CMC）部分。您将要写的内容如何与整体情况相契合？CMC的指南将这些组成部分分解为可管理的信息组合，包括（1）药物物质，（2）药物产品，（3）方法验证和（4）环境评估。在每个组合中还有子组合。因此，您可以准备每个组合的组成部分，然后进行组合。当然，在此之前您需要进行功课。确保您充分理解自己要表达的内容。

The preliminary work can be tedious, to be sure, but starting the actual writing is usually the toughest part. Many people complain of “writer’s block,” or the inability to get words down on paper. If you suffer from bouts of writer’s block, there are some steps you can take to overcome these down periods. See the following.

的确，初期的准备工作可能很乏味，但实际开始写作通常是最困难的部分。许多人抱怨遭遇“写作障碍”，即无法将思绪转化为文字。如果您遇到写作障碍，可以采取一些步骤来克服这些低潮期。请参考以下建议。

    Arnold Melnick, author of Melnick on Writing, a column in the AMWA Journal, the publication of the American Medical Writers Association, offers five questions to help writers understand their writing patterns.
<p>
    Arnold Melnick是《Melnick on Writing》一书的作者，该书是美国医学作家协会（AMWA）期刊《AMWA Journal》上的专栏。他提出了五个问题，帮助作家了解他们的写作模式。
    </p>
    <center><b>Only You Can Solve Your Writer’s Block 只有你能解决写作障碍</b></center>
    Writer’s block is the “temporary inability by a writer to put words on a page.” It’s a common experience for writers, but there are things you can do about it. Answering five simple questions accurately and intelligently can provide an answer to this affliction.<br>
    写作障碍是指作家在一段时间内无法将文字写在纸上的临时困难。这是作家常见的经历，但你可以采取一些措施来解决它。准确而明智地回答五个简单的问题可以找到应对这一困扰的答案。
    <p>1. Do you struggle vainly to “write” something instead of communicating information or ideas to the reader?<br>你是否徒劳地努力“写作”，而不是向读者传达信息或思想？</p>
    <p>
         According to Joel Saltzman, author of If You Can Talk, You Can Write, write anything as though you are talking to a friend. Write whatever words might be associated with your document, without pausing to criticize or edit. Intersperse it with whatever random thoughts come to your mind. Then, edit and edit carefully. Good writing is good editing. Very few writers can get their desired effect in the first draft. For writers, how they edit determines whether the writing is good or not.<br>
        根据乔尔·索尔兹曼（Joel Saltzman）在《如果你能说话，你就能写作》一书中的说法，以与朋友交谈的方式来写作。随意写下与你的文档相关的任何词语，不要停下来批评或编辑。在其中穿插你脑海中出现的任何随机想法。然后进行仔细的编辑和修订。优秀的写作来自于良好的编辑。很少有作家能在第一稿中达到他们想要的效果。对于作家来说，他们如何进行编辑决定了写作的好坏。
    </p>
    <p>
        2.Do you know your own patterns of creativity?<br>
        你了解自己的创造力模式吗？
    </p>
    <p>
What are the most favorable work conditions for you? Do you write best early in the morning, late in the day, or at night? Do you do better work with a dish of candy next to your computer or while
abstaining from sweets? Do you work better alone or with people nearby? To get the most out of your writing, observe and respect your own personal idiosyncrasies. They guide creativity — or at least they don’t block it.<br>
        对你来说，最有利的工作条件是什么？你是在早上、晚上还是夜晚时写作效果最好？你是在电脑旁边放一碟糖果的情况下工作得更好，还是在不吃甜食的情况下更出色？你是独自工作还是与周围的人一起工作效果更好？为了充分发挥你的写作能力，观察并尊重自己的个人特点。它们指导着创造力，或者至少不会阻碍它。
    </p>
    <p>
        3.Do you work best with notes or without notes?<br>
    你是更适合带着笔记工作还是不带笔记工作？</p>
<p>
Writers work in different patterns. Some do better with copious notes, others with outlines, others with sketchy notes, and still others without any notes at all. In some cases, writers do better using notes for factual documents (as in reporting data) and without notes for less concrete material (as in light correspondence) — or vice versa. People have different patterns of behavior for different types of writing.<br>
    写作者的工作模式各不相同。有些人在撰写时需要大量的笔记，有些人则需要提纲，还有一些人只需要简单的笔记，还有些人则完全不需要任何笔记。在某些情况下，撰写事实性文件（如报告数据）时使用笔记效果更好，而在撰写较为抽象的材料（如轻松的通信）时则不需要笔记，或者反之亦然。对于不同类型的写作，人们具有不同的行为模式。
    </p>
    <p>
        3.Is your problem ideas or words?<br>
    你的问题是创意还是用词？</p>
<p>
    If your difficulty is in ideas, it means that you have no concept of how to get where you want to go. In such a case, here are two recommendations. First, just scribble some notes or words about your idea and about your concepts. Later on, you can flesh out these notes. Second, handwrite some of your thoughts because in the extra time it takes to write out concepts you will probably be able to fill in some of the creative thoughts you had in the first place. <br>
    如果你在创意方面遇到困难，这意味着你不知道如何实现你的目标。在这种情况下，我有两个建议。首先，简单地写下关于你的想法和概念的一些笔记或词语。稍后你可以进一步完善这些笔记。其次，手写一些你的想法，因为在写下概念时，你可能能够填补一开始就有的一些创造性思维。
</p>
<p>
    If your difficulty is in words, it means that you know what you want to say, but can’t quite say it. One of the better ways to approach this difficulty is to determine which section of the document you are most sure of, then write it first, even if it is out of order.Everything does not have to be written in sequence.<br>
    如果你在用词方面遇到困难，这意味着你知道自己想要表达什么，但却无法准确表达出来。解决这个困难的较好方法之一是确定你最确定的文件部分，然后首先写下它，即使它不按顺序。并不是每件事都必须按顺序写。</p>
<p>
    A second approach is to write down a few of the key words of your document and then expand them by word association. For example, if you are writing a report on a meeting, you might jot down “meeting,” “election,” “conference room,” and “Tuesday morning.” You can then add other words to each of those original words until you have sketched an outline that will permit you to start writing. Next, add material to it. Remember, you can edit out all the extraneous material.<br>
    第二种方法是先写下你的文件中的几个关键词，然后通过联想来扩展它们。例如，如果你正在撰写一份会议报告，你可以记下“会议”、“选举”、“会议室”和“星期二早上”。然后，你可以为每个关键词添加其他词汇，直到你勾勒出一个可以开始写作的大纲。接下来，添加内容。记住，你可以编辑掉所有多余的材料。
    </p>
    <p>
        5. Are you a procrastinator?<br>
    你是个拖延症患者吗？</p>
   <p>
       Procrastination may well be a genetic thing: some people are procrastinators,  some are not, and some swing back and forth. What is  important is that each writer recognize personal patterns of procrastination.  When given a task, do you attack it immediately, or almost  immediately, regardless of when the deadline is or what the import?  Or, no matter how serious the job, do you put it off until almost the  last minute? Look at how you shop. Look at how you pay bills. Look  at how you study for examinations. Good examples, all. Examine  your behavior in writing situations and determine whether or not  — or how much — you are a procrastinator.<br>
    拖延可能是一种遗传特征：有些人容易拖延，有些人不会，还有一些人在两者之间徘徊。重要的是每个写作者都要认识到自己的拖延习惯。当面临任务时，你是立即着手完成，不论截止日期是什么时候或者任务的重要性如何？还是无论任务有多重要，你总是拖到最后一刻才开始？看看你购物的方式，看看你支付账单的方式，看看你备考考试的方式。这些都是很好的例子。检视你在写作情境中的行为，确定自己是否是一个拖延症患者，或者拖延的程度有多大。</p>
<p>
    Here’s a recommendation to help procrastinators: sit and sit and sit. Station yourself in front of your computer and do not yield to the temptation to get up and walk around or do anything else. Stay seated for a reasonable period until your thoughts start to flow. Others recommend two other approaches. Interestingly, they are opposites. Some experts say start with the most difficult task and get it out of the way, noting that the rest will then be easier. Others recommend the reverse: start with the easiest things because they can be done quickly, and then gradually work your way up to the most difficult task. Meanwhile, you will already have written much of the work. Still another recommendation is to “take five.” Walk around the building, take a short coffee break, do some deep breathing. But, if you “get away” like this, try not to substitute something you enjoy, such as eating ice cream. In essence, don’t reward behavior that you shouldn’t encourage.<br>
    对于拖延症患者，这里有一个建议：坐下来，坐下来，再坐下来。将自己安置在电脑前，不要被走动或做其他事情的诱惑所动摇。坐在那里一段合理的时间，直到你的思绪开始流动起来。其他人提出了另外两种方法。有趣的是，它们正好相反。一些专家建议从最困难的任务开始，将其解决掉，然后其他任务就会变得更容易。而另一些人则建议相反：从最容易的事情开始，因为它们可以迅速完成，然后逐渐递进地完成最困难的任务。与此同时，你已经完成了大部分的工作。还有另一个建议是“休息一下”。绕着建筑物走走，进行短暂的咖啡休息，做些深呼吸。但是，如果你这样“离开”，尽量不要用你喜欢的事物来替代，比如吃冰淇淋。实质上，不要奖励那些你不应该鼓励的行为。</p>
<p>
    It’s also wise to get a sounding board if you have difficulty organizing your thoughts or words. Use a dictating machine, or find a colleague who will act as a sounding board so you can tell what you want to say. You will then probably have created your own first rough draft. This process ties in with natural law that you can talk or dictate about ten times as fast as you can write, so when an idea strikes your brain you can record it in a shorter period of time by speaking, losing far less of the thought. Then transcribe what you’ve said.<br>
    如果你在组织思绪或文字方面遇到困难，寻求一个发声板是明智的选择。使用一个录音机，或找一个同事充当发声板，这样你就可以表达你想要说的话。然后，你很可能已经创建了自己的初稿。这个过程符合自然法则，即你说话或口述的速度大约是写作的十倍，因此当一个想法闪过你的脑海时，你可以通过口述在更短的时间内记录下来，减少思维的损失。然后将你所说的内容转录下来。</p>

## Writing and Revising 撰写与修订

>The best motivation for writing is a deadline.
>最好的写作动力是截止日期。
>——Kristine Ogozalek,Regulatory Manager


Just about anyone can write *something* ——it’s what happens to it after the first draft that makes it good. In short, pretty much everything that’s written can use some skillful editing and revision. Unless you are a genius, good writing doesn’t just happen. It’s the result of drafting, revising, reassessing, and revising again. Further, the more eyes that see a piece of writing, the better it usually is. This is especially true of the highly technical writing that’s the norm in regulated industries.

几乎任何人都可以写出一些东西，但真正决定作品好坏的是在第一稿之后的修改与修订。简而言之，几乎所有的文字作品都可以通过熟练的编辑和修订来提升。除非你是天才，优秀的写作不是一蹴而就的结果，而是通过起草、修订、重新评估和再次修订来完成的。此外，更多的眼睛看到一篇作品通常会使其变得更好。这在受到监管的行业中尤其如此，因为这些行业通常需要进行高度技术性的写作。

Most writers have had the experience of proofreading their own words and giving the copy an okay, only to discover too late that they overlooked glaring errors because they did what humans tend to do: They saw what they expected to see and not what was there. On the other hand, a writer may spend hours developing an idea or researching a detail, then notice that to include it would confuse or mislead. In such circumstances, the only recourse is to cut the passage. Developing your own writing is no easy task, for you are dealing with yourself as a writer. You may know exactly what you mean, whereas your readers may not. That’s why review and revision play a strong role.

大多数作家都有这样的经历：他们自己校对文字并认为一切都没问题，直到事后才发现自己忽视了明显的错误，因为人们往往会看到他们期望看到的东西，而不是实际存在的东西。另一方面，作家可能会花费数小时来发展一个思想或研究一个细节，然后意识到将其包含在内会引起混淆或误导。在这种情况下，唯一的选择就是删去这段文字。发展自己的写作并不容易，因为你要与自己作为一个作家打交道。你可能非常清楚自己的意思，而读者可能不清楚。这就是为什么审查和修订起到重要作用的原因。

If you write simple memos, e-mails, faxes, and letters that no one but you sees before distribution, it’s best to draft the document and let it rest, if you can. Come back to it and look at it again. Read it out loud if you have the luxury of time. (This helps you “hear” as well as “see.”) If the piece is important, ask someone else to read it through, and be open to suggestions. Be appreciative when a typo or misspelling comes to light, so you can make changes to improve your writing for the better. Do the best fine-tuning you can; draft and revise until the document is as good as you can make it.

如果你写的是简单的备忘录、电子邮件、传真和信函，在分发之前没有其他人看到，最好是起草文件后让它休息一下，如果可能的话。然后回过头再看一遍。如果有充裕的时间，可以大声朗读它（这有助于你“听到”和“看到”）。如果这篇文章很重要，可以请别人帮忙阅读，并对建议持开放态度。当发现拼写错误时，要感激，并进行改正以提高你的写作质量。尽可能进行最好的微调；起草和修订，直到文件达到你能做到的最好水平。

If you are writing a document for a formal review, remember that the better the quality is prior to the review process, the quicker the approval will be forthcoming. Your reviewers, in particular, will thank you for your diligence, because their task will be easier. And in the long run, you may spend less time trying to get the text through final approval.

如果你要撰写一份需要正式审核的文件，请记住，在审核过程之前，文件的质量越好，获得批准的速度就越快。特别是你的审阅者将会感谢你的勤奋，因为这会使他们的任务更容易。从长远来看，你可能会花更少的时间来争取最终批准的文本。

### Collaborative Writing 协作撰写

Collaborative writing means that two or more people conjointly contribute information to the draft and completion of a single document. For example, work that runs continuously, such as pilot plant operations, requires systematic record keeping across shifts. Those records may ultimately feed into reports, with several people preparing sections. Certainly, equipment installation and operation protocols and qualification reports require the expertise of all who work on a specific project. Clinical trial reports may have more than one writer, and certainly dossiers headed to regulatory agencies have a host of authors who have provided input.

协作写作意味着两个或更多人共同为一份文件的起草和完成提供信息。例如，连续进行的工作（如试验工厂操作）需要跨班次进行系统的记录。这些记录最终可能会整合到报告中，由多个人负责准备各个部分。当然，设备安装和操作协议以及鉴定报告需要所有参与特定项目的人员的专业知识。临床试验报告可能有多个撰写者，而提交给监管机构的档案则由许多提供意见的作者组成。

>Common sense is not so common. 常识并非那么平常
>——Voltaire

Writers working collaboratively on documents must offer information that ultimately serves one purpose, and although that can be difficult, it’s common. What’s needed when people embark upon a joint writing venture is a clear understanding up front and a sense of document ownership. Many a collaborative writing project has gone awry because none of the writers assumed ownership, and the end product became a document with no clear purpose, simply a compilation of information without unity.

在共同撰写文件时，参与者必须提供最终服务于一个目的的信息，尽管这可能很困难，但却很常见。当人们开始共同撰写时，需要明确的事先了解和文档所有权的意识。许多共同撰写项目失败的原因是没有人承担所有权，最终的成果变成了一个没有明确目的、只是信息的汇编而缺乏统一性的文件。

Writers need to agree on the main purpose and supporting points for the document. Often each writer can clarify the others’ thoughts because all have a solid — but somewhat differing — vision of the main idea. Discussion helps clarify the purpose of the report, and this discussion is best done up front before the writing process begins. The next thing to do is to decide who is going to write what. If you write collaboratively, work with your coauthors to define the process that’s easiest for all involved. The two approaches that follow are equally workable, and both require some negotiation skills.

作者需要就文档的主要目的和支持论点达成一致。通常，每个作者都可以澄清其他人的想法，因为他们对主要观点有一个坚实但略有不同的理解。讨论有助于明确报告的目的，这种讨论最好在写作过程开始之前进行。接下来要做的是决定谁来写什么。如果你在合作撰写，与合作者合作制定对所有参与者最容易的过程。下面的两种方法都是可行的，但都需要一些谈判技巧。

#### The First Approach 第一种方法

The first approach calls for a designated person to draft the document and for the others to add and amend. That’s not to say the first person shouldn’t review and be permitted adjustments to the text before submission of the finished product. The strength of this system is that the person with the strongest language skills does the “cleaning up,” while the writers with the strongest technical expertise have their say. Alterations in the text are with the approval of all writers. You’ll find this approach to be particularly efficient in the composition of short documents.

第一种方法是指定一个人起草文档，其他人进行添加和修订。这并不意味着第一个人在提交最终成果之前不应该对文本进行审查和调整。这种系统的优势在于语言技巧最强的人进行“修整”，而在技术专长最强的撰写者发表自己的意见。文本的修改需要得到所有撰写者的批准。你会发现这种方法在撰写短文档时特别高效。

#### The Second Approach 第二种方法

The second approach requires more planning than the first approach. In this approach, the writers assess needs of the document and assume ownership of specific portions. All writers need to understand the components of the planned document and what needs to reside where. They then agree on the formatting conventions and the time for text completion. Writers then meet to combine the elements and polish the document, with each reading and making comments on the entire text. Revision and refinement should come through tactful commentary and with the consent of the writer responsible for each individual section. This approach is usually the most effective in the composition of reports or other documents of length.

第二种方法比第一种方法需要更多的规划。在这种方法中，撰写者评估文档的需求，并承担特定部分的责任。所有撰写者需要了解计划文档的组成部分以及各个部分的安排。然后，他们就格式约定和文本完成的时间达成一致。撰写者之后会进行会面，将各个部分合并并完善文档，每个人都会阅读整个文本并发表意见。修订和改进应通过得体的评论，并经过负责每个单独部分的撰写者的同意。这种方法通常在撰写报告或其他较长文档时最有效。

### Reaching Agreement 达成一致

Trust in other people’s expertise and a willingness to accept their judgment are crucial to collaborative writing. Remember also that two or more people will have distinct writing styles, and that those styles may vary dramatically; yet sometimes the style distinctions will be barely discernible. Try not to make arbitrary alterations in your coauthors’ work; similarly, be tolerant of any minor changes a coauthor may make in your writing, and reach agreement as to the clarity and completeness of the message. And remember, nothing does as much for a common goal as conversation. If you feel a change is necessary, discuss it. Chances are greater that your collaborators will agree after they’ve heard your explanation. Similarly, you’ll feel better about text adjustments after you’ve had the opportunity to hear why your coauthors feel they should be made. Discussion, after all, is the bond that makes collaboration workable in the first place.

信任他人的专业知识并愿意接受他们的判断对于协作写作至关重要。同时，要记住两个或更多人会有不同的写作风格，而这些风格可能存在巨大的差异；然而有时候这些风格的区别可能很微小。尽量不要对合著者的作品进行任意更改；同样，对合著者对你的写作进行的任何小的改动要保持宽容，并就信息的清晰度和完整性达成一致意见。而且要记住，对于共同目标来说，没有什么比交流更有帮助。如果你觉得需要进行改变，进行讨论。在听到你的解释之后，你的合作者更有可能同意。同样地，当你有机会听到合著者为何认为需要进行文本调整时，你会对这些调整感到更加满意。毕竟，讨论是使协作变得可行的纽带。

Finally, when writing collaboratively, make every effort to present a document that’s cohesive, clear, and grammatical. Getting a document to this point may take many readings, discussions, and revisions. Your collective goal should be the end result: a quality document ready for either immediate distribution or formal review that will be well received.

最后，在协作写作时，要尽一切努力呈现一份连贯、清晰和符合语法规范的文件。要达到这个目标可能需要多次阅读、讨论和修订。你们的共同目标应该是最终的成果：一份质量优秀的文件，可以立即分发或经过正式审查并受到良好的接受。

It doesn’t matter what kind of writing you are collaborating on. The following is an abstract written by three people: a vice president of development, a regulatory manager, and a consultant. In preliminary discussions, the three determined to submit an abstract to present at an industry conference. The requirement called for a maximum of 300 words. They had several ideas, then narrowed them down to defining how a company can make the transition from discovery to a compliant development operation. The regulatory manager tackled the task of getting the idea down on paper. Here is the first pass. Notice that the manager asks a few questions of her coauthors, and that this draft is far from complete. It has 114 words.

无论你们在协作写作什么类型的文档，都没有关系。以下是由三个人共同撰写的摘要：一位发展副总裁、一位法规经理和一位顾问。在初步讨论中，这三个人决定提交一份摘要，以便在行业会议上进行演讲。要求摘要的字数不超过300个字。他们有几个想法，然后将其缩小为如何使一家公司从发现阶段转变为合规的开发运营。法规经理负责将这个想法写下来。以下是初稿。请注意，经理向她的合著者提出了一些问题，而且这个草稿远远不完整。它有114个字。

The final word count is 300, and the message is succinctly delivered. Here’s a happy note: The abstract was accepted and the authors presented at the conference.

最终的字数达到了300字，并且信息简洁明了地传达出来。一个令人高兴的消息是：摘要被接受，并且作者们在会议上进行了展示。

The revision has 298 words. When the Vice President had a look, she had a few changes, notably that the scope was too broad. In one short presentation,
the trio could not discuss discovery to marketplace. Thus the scope is limited to development, and the abstract discusses only that bridge. Further,
she focuses on “young” rather than “newer” companies. She also opted to say “research and development” as a single entity; thus the verb is singular.
The result is a better abstract. (Her edits are underlined.)

修订稿共有298个单词。副总裁查看后提出了一些修改意见，注意到范围过于广泛。在一个简短的演讲中，三人无法讨论从研究到市场的整个过程。因此，范围被限制在发展阶段，摘要仅涵盖这一过程。此外，她更注重"年轻"而不是"新的"公司。她还选择将"研究与开发"作为一个整体来表达，因此动词是单数形式。结果是一个更好的摘要。（她的修改已用下划线标出。）

## Document Formal Review 文件正式审核
Many documents are subject to a formal review process. You may participate as either author or reviewer, and both roles can be daunting. An understanding of the process itself and of the revision that’s inherent as a result will make your task as writer or reviewer easier.

许多文件都需要经过正式的审核流程。您可以作为作者或审核人员参与其中，而这两种角色都可能令人生畏。了解审核过程本身以及由此产生的修订将使您作为作者或审核人员的任务更加轻松。

### Serving as a Reviewer 作为审核人员

As reviewer, the first thing you must understand in practicing your skills is this: Although reviewing in itself is far from child’s play, altering a piece of writing is easier than creating the original. Your task is difficult because many people are sensitive about what they’ve written, and they have a right to be. The writer who has a sense of ownership in what he has written communicates pride in the work, and that spirit is conducive to good business.

作为审核人员，您首先要明白的是：虽然审核本身并不是儿戏，但修改一篇文章比起创作原作要容易得多。您的任务之所以困难，是因为许多人对自己所写的内容都很敏感，而且他们有权这样做。作为作者，对自己所写的作品有一种所有权感，表达出对工作的自豪感，这种精神有助于良好的业务发展。

Before you put pen to paper, first understand that writing always reflects the writer; it’s a portrait of the person who created it, and a writer will usually defend what she’s created, even if it doesn’t “measure up” to your criteria. Often, too, a writer’s defense of her work stems from an insecurity about her own writing ability. You must, therefore, exercise some human resource skills in addition to your language skills. Make your comments with respect.

在您动笔之前，首先要明白的是，写作总是反映作者本人；它是作者的一幅画像，即使它不符合您的标准，作者通常也会为自己创作的内容辩护。而且，作者对自己作品的辩护往往源于对自己写作能力的不安。因此，您需要在语言技能之外运用一些人力资源技巧。请以尊重（作者）地态度提出您的意见。

First, understand what’s basic to human nature: The very act of writing is a thinking process; and words, your own and others’, trigger new ideas and,
often, alternate ways of saying the same thing. Thus, it’s extra easy to have your own sense of language stimulated by what you’re reading, and it’s something to consider with care.

首先，要理解人性的基本特点：写作本身就是一个思考的过程；文字，不论是你自己的还是他人的，都会引发新的想法，常常会产生表达同一内容的不同方式。因此，你的语言感觉很容易受到你所阅读的内容的刺激，这是需要仔细考虑的事情。

Your job when reviewing anyone else’s writing is to assist in creating clear, readable documents. Here’s a bit of common sense: There’s always more than one right way to say just about anything. Another person’s way of saying something may not be like yours, but that doesn’t mean it’s not equally good.

当你审核他人的写作时，你的工作是帮助创建清晰易读的文件。这是一点常识：几乎任何事情都有多种正确的表达方式。另一个人表达某事的方式可能与你不同，但这并不意味着它不够好。

### The Writer’s Voice 作者的声音

The words a writer uses and the structures of his sentences are as uniquely his as his fingerprints. These elements flavor what he says. If you’re reviewing a document you can change *ambivalent* to *ambiguous* or *between* to *among* when it’s necessary, and you can let a writer know when more or less background or explanation is needed to make meaning clear. You can suggest concrete, specific, everyday words for an audience that will be unimpressed — or worse, confused — by inflated, generalized, uncommon ones. But you should steer clear of changes that don’t materially affect the way the message is understood, or the way the intended audience will receive it.

作者使用的词语和句子结构与他的指纹一样独特。这些元素为他所说的内容增添了特色。如果你正在审核一份文件，在必要时你可以将“ambivalent”改为“ambiguous”，将“between”改为“among”，并让作家知道何时需要更多或更少的背景或解释来使意义清晰。你可以为受众提出具体、具体、日常的词语，对于那些过于夸张、泛泛而谈、不常见的词语，受众可能会感受不到，甚至感到困惑。但你应该避免进行不会实质性影响信息理解方式或目标受众接受方式的更改。

### Making Comments 发表评论
Reviewing is different from collaborative writing. You can see what happens when an editor’s own writing style is imposed on someone else’s writing. A supervisor submitted an update on a laboratory project that included the following line

审核与协作写作不同。当编辑的写作风格强加于他人的写作时，就会出现一些问题。一位主管提交了一个关于实验项目的更新，其中包括以下句子：

*Three unknowns are inherent.（三个未知因素是固有的。）*

His manager crossed it out and wrote the following 他的经理划掉了这句话，并写下了以下内容:

*Three unknowns are innate.（三个未知因素是内在的。）*

Such correction does nothing to improve communication, and it delivers its own unspoken message: “You can’t say it right, but I can.” This sort of supercilious, authoritarian revision serves no good purpose; in fact, it hinders the business of getting the job done. So if you are reviewing someone else’s writing, remember, if a piece works, leave it alone. The practical effectiveness of the final product is your only concern. And a good final product depends not only on your sense of the factually, grammatically correct but also on your respect for the writer’s judgment. To change without purpose only confuses and often angers. Surely poor judgment lies behind a comment such as the following that appeared on an SOP as it moved through review:

*“Confusing. Rewrite!!”*

这样的修正对改进沟通没有任何帮助，而且传达了自己未明言的信息：“你说不对，但我可以。”这种傲慢、专断的修订没有任何好处；事实上，它阻碍了完成工作的进程。所以，如果你在审查他人的写作时，请记住，如果一篇文章已经达到预期效果，就不要再修改它。最终产品的实际有效性是你唯一关心的。一个好的最终产品不仅取决于你对事实和语法的正确判断，还取决于你对作者判断的尊重。没有目的地进行改动只会造成困惑，通常还会引起愤怒。当一个标准操作程序（SOP）在审查过程中出现以下评论时，无疑是因为判断不当：

*"令人困惑。重写！！"*

A dictate such as this fuels resentment, and in fact, it’s an attack. Would it not be better to say, “I’m not sure whether you mean A or B. Can you clarify?” This critique places the responsibility for a reader’s understanding on the writer’s shoulders.

这样的命令性批评会激起反感，实际上，它是一种攻击。更好的做法难道不是说，“我不确定你是指A还是B。你能否澄清一下？”这种批评将读者理解的责任放在了作者的肩上。通过这样的方式，我们给予作者更多的责任，使其能够清楚地传达信息。

Most documents require numerous reviewers, and people need to think about content — what works and what doesn’t.  Epiphany may not come until a reviewer has looked at a document for a second or third time. When a writer drafts a document like an SOP, it usually goes into a mandatory review cycle, so the norm is reviewers’ comments and subsequent revisions based on those comments. The same is true for documents of great length — reviewers may need to see a document in its various phases of development and in its final stages more than one time.

大多数文件需要多个审核人，人们需要思考内容——什么有效，什么无效。顿悟可能直到审核人第二次或第三次查看文件时才会出现。当作者起草一份标准操作规程（SOP）等文件时，通常需要经过强制审核周期，因此常规做法是审核人的评论以及基于这些评论的后续修订。对于很长的文件也是如此——审核人可能需要多次查看文件的不同开发阶段以及最终阶段。

>Asking a working writer what he thinks about critics is like asking a lamppost what it feels about dogs.

    询问一个工作中的作家对评论家的看法，就像问一个路灯柱子对狗的感受如何一样。
    
    ​		——John Osborne, Writer

One final note: Writers are most effective if they feel relaxed and encouraged, with a person to consult when they’re blocked or unsure about mechanics. Your job as a reviewer will be easier and your results better if you approach it looking for the positive and downplaying the negative. Good reviewers can inspire people to build their strengths; as that happens, the negatives evaporate! Focusing on negative performance, on the other hand, does not eliminate weaknesses, but rather diminishes the strengths. To get the best documentation, first identify the writer’s best: Then build from there. When the document completes a review cycle, the writer can readily tell what is needed to create a complete, working vehicle.

最后一点：作家在感到轻松和受到鼓励的情况下才能最有效地工作，他们需要有人可以咨询，当他们遇到障碍或对语法有疑问时。如果你在审核时积极寻找优点并淡化缺点，你的工作将更轻松，结果也会更好。优秀的审核者可以激励人们发展自己的优势，随着这一过程的进行，负面因素会消散！而如果过于关注负面表现，将不会消除弱点，反而会削弱优势。为了获得最佳的文档，首先要识别出作家的优势，然后从这些优势出发进行改进。当文档经过审核流程后，作家能够很容易地知道需要做哪些工作来创建一个完整、可行的文档。

### Guidelines for Reviewing Documents 文档审核指南

How many times have you picked up a pen or pencil, ready to annotate before you’ve read a word? Sometimes, initial restraint facilitates the task. Keep the following guidelines in mind when you must review the writing of others.

有多少次你在还没读到一字之前就拿起笔准备做批注？有时候，最初的克制会有助于任务的完成。在审查他人的写作时，请牢记以下准则。

1. Determine the purpose/objective of the document. Make sure you fully understand the job the document has to do.<br>确定文档的目的和目标。确保你完全理解文档需要完成的任务。

2. Read the document through in its entirety for substance. Do not hold a pen in your hand. The temptation to make comments can be overwhelming; yet an emendation to a document on page one may prove unnecessary if the author covers the same ground, perhaps even more effectively, in a later section.<br>全文阅读文档，关注其内容要点。不要拿着笔。对于修改意见的冲动可能会很强烈，但如果作者在后面的部分涵盖了相同的内容，甚至更有效地表达，那么在第一页对文档进行修改可能是不必要的。

3. Read the document through a second time if you have the luxury; then reflect on it before coming back to it.<br>如果你有时间的话，可以再次全文阅读文档，然后反思一下，再回过头来审查它。

4. If the document covers a process, reread the sequential steps again. If you can, allow some “resting” time before you make any changes.<br>如果文档涉及一个过程，请再次阅读其中的顺序步骤。如果可能的话，在进行任何更改之前，留出一些时间来让其休整。

5. Be positive, not negative, in your comments. Suggest, don’t insist.<br>在评论中保持积极态度，而非消极。建议而不是坚持己见。

6. Annotate in order of importance for the following 按照以下重要性的顺序进行批注:

   - Content, completeness, and logic — Is the document comprehensive and understandable?<br>内容、完整性和逻辑性 — 文档是否全面且易于理解？
   - Consistency — Do all parts of the document work together?<br>一致性 — 文档的各个部分是否相互协调？
   - Language — Are there typos and spelling errors? Is the grammar correct? Are word choices appropriate?<br>语言表达 — 是否存在拼写错误和错别字？语法是否正确？词汇选择是否恰当？

7. And remember, if the document works, leave it alone. Never “fix” what doesn’t need it.<br>请记住，如果文档有效，就不要去改动它。不要对不需要修正的部分进行“修复”。

### Serving as Author During Document Review 在文档审核过程中担任作者角色

Those who review your writing may have valid comments about the content. Someone else’s perspective may be just what your document needs to make it do its job. If, too, a reviewer is less than constructive in his or her criticism, step back emotionally.  Don’t take negative, unproductive notations personally. Such commentary often reflects any number of agendas coincidental to the task at hand. Often posing a diplomatic question to a reviewer yields not only conciliation but also positive results in the document.

对于审核您的写作的人来说，他们可能对内容有有效的评论。他人的观点可能正是您的文档所需要的，以使其达到其目的。如果某个审核人在批评中缺乏建设性，情感上要保持冷静。不要将消极、无生产力的批注当作个人攻击。这样的评论通常反映出与任务有关的各种巧合的议程。通常向审核人提出一些委婉的问题不仅可以达成和解，而且对文档产生积极的影响。

It’s a secure writer who questions reviewers’ comments. Often the outcome is a discussion that yields an entirely different — and infinitely better — result. Be open to different perspectives for getting the job done well. And remember, the call-outs a reviewer finds may make the difference between a document that goes the distance or one that comes back for revision again.

一个有把握的作家会质疑审核人的评论。往往结果是一场讨论，产生了完全不同且更好的结果。要对不同的观点持开放态度，以便将工作做好。并且请记住，审核人发现的问题可能决定了文档能否一次通过或需要进行修订。

## Considering the Effects of Diversity 考虑到多样性的影响

Not all writers of American English are native born. What that means, of course, is that the writing that gets done in English may reflect the native tongue of the writer. Leaving out articles, for instance, is a deviation common to writers whose native language doesn’t have them, such as Asian and Eastern European languages. These are not serious omissions and usually don’t create context problems. Reviewers can readily insert them.

并非所有以英语写作的美国英语作家都是以英语为母语的。这意味着，用英语进行的写作可能会反映作者的母语。例如，漏掉冠词是非英语为母语的作家常见的偏差，比如亚洲和东欧语言的母语者。这些并不是严重的遗漏，通常不会造成语境问题。审核人员可以很容易地补充上这些冠词。

Prepositions are pesky, too, for many writers. The Germanic languages have them in abundance, and English is a Germanic language. The Romance languages — French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, and Romanian — have them, but they don’t translate perfectly. Still other languages, such as Chinese, don’t have them at all. Most foreign-born writers struggle with some elements of  the language, and the difficulty of knowing what and how to document is often compounded by insecurity about the working structure of English.

对于许多写作者来说，介词也是一个棘手的问题。日耳曼语系的语言大量使用介词，而英语是日耳曼语系的一种语言。罗曼语系的语言，如法语、西班牙语、意大利语、葡萄牙语和罗马尼亚语，也有介词，但它们并不能完全对应翻译。其他一些语言，比如中文，根本没有介词。大多数外国出生的作家在语言的某些方面都会遇到困难，对于如何进行文档编写的选择和方式，往往受到对英语工作结构的不安的影响而更加困扰。我们需要理解这些写作者在语言上的挣扎，并尊重他们的努力。

If you are such a writer or work with the documentation of such writers, here’s the important thing: The errors typical in the  writings of those who have learned English as adults don’t reflect lack of intelligence; they simply reflect a struggle for mastery of the language. Accept the reality and give or take suggestions with grace.

如果你是这样的写作者或者与这样的写作者的文档工作相关，这里有一件重要的事情：那些已经成年学习英语的人在写作中常见的错误并不代表他们缺乏智力，而只是反映了他们在掌握语言方面的努力和挣扎。接受这个现实，并以优雅的方式接受或提出建议。我们应该以包容的态度对待他们的努力，并互相帮助进步。

## Setting Priorities for Writing 为写作设定优先事项

Ideally, to produce a clear, easily understood document, whether you have written all or part of it or are reviewing it, you should adhere to commonsense guidelines for writing and reviewing. To have the time to allow a document in various stages of development sit while you think about the content, perhaps as you work on another job or while you attend a meeting or go to lunch, is a luxury, to be sure, but it offers advantages. When you come back to the document, read it again; then make your adjustments. This may seem impossible, given the demands the working day places on you, but important documentation especially needs all the effort you can give it. Understanding the strictures under which you work will help. The most omnipresent is allotted time available: It is often simply not enough. All you can do then, of course, is the best possible job in the time you have. Intelligent assessment of any task will always reveal that the amount of time spent on a job will directly affect its outcome.  Be realistic. For some projects there is very little time; for others, there is more.

理想情况下，为了撰写一份清晰易懂的文档，无论你是完全自己写作还是进行审查，你都应该遵循一些常识性的写作和审查准则。让文档在不同的开发阶段保持一段时间的休息，让你有时间思考内容，或许在你做其他工作、参加会议或吃午饭时，虽然这是一种奢侈，但它会带来优势。当你回到文档时，再次阅读它，然后进行调整。考虑到工作日对你的要求，这似乎是不可能的，但重要的文档尤其需要你付出所有的努力。了解你所工作的严格限制会有所帮助。最普遍存在的限制是时间的分配：通常时间是不够的。当然，在你所拥有的时间内，你所能做的就是尽力完成最好的工作。明智的评估任何任务都会揭示出工作所花费的时间将直接影响其结果。要保持现实。对于某些项目来说，时间非常紧迫；而对于其他项目来说，时间则相对更充裕。

To allot the maximum time to the tasks at hand for every document, set priorities. If, for instance, several “rush” jobs need to be finished by the end of the workday, take some initial time and evaluate your given tasks. Arrange them in order of importance, most urgent to least, and address them in that order. That way, you’ll address the most important task first, and, with luck, you’ll be able to let it “rest” while you tackle another document and come back to it with a fresh eye. 

为了将最大的时间分配给每个文档的任务，需要设定优先事项。例如，如果有几个“急件”需要在工作日结束之前完成，花一些时间来评估所给定的任务。按重要性的顺序进行排列，从最紧急到最不紧急，并按照这个顺序处理它们。这样，你将首先处理最重要的任务，并且幸运的话，你可以在处理其他文档时让它“休息”，然后以全新的眼光回来处理它。

This approach may not always work. There’s no accounting for the lastminute emergency, the job demanding you let everything else drop and attend to it, but many times setting priorities will give you the upper hand and let you control your work and prevent your work from controlling you.

这种方法并不总是适用。无法预料到最后一刻的紧急情况，有些任务要求你放下其他事情，立即处理它。但是，许多情况下设定优先事项会让你占据主动，掌控你的工作，防止工作控制你。这样做能让你在工作中保持控制，并避免被工作所束缚。
